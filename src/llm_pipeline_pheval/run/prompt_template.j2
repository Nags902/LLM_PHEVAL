Task:
Based on the above clinical data, please analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, please provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank)
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
Return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:
{% raw %}

  "ranked_diseases": [
    {
      "disease_name": "DiseaseName",
      "disease_id": "DiseaseID",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Brief explanation."
    }
  ]
