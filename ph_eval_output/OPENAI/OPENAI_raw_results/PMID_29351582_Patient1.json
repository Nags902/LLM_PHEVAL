      "disease_id": "OMIM:614302",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The provided phenotype features of loss of ambulation, distal lower limb amyotrophy, frequent falls, motor axonal neuropathy, and impaired vibratory sensation have a strong overlap with previously diagnosed cases of Neuronopathy, distal hereditary motor, autosomal dominant 11. The similarity in the phenotypic profile strongly supports this diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Type 2A1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:118210",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2A1 is characterized by features like distal muscle weakness and atrophy, along with motor axonal neuropathy and impaired vibratory sensation. Although facial musculature weakness is less common, the overall symptom profile fits with this condition."

      "disease_name": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Distal, Autosomal Dominant",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:600175",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This condition shares features such as lower limb amyotrophy, frequent falls, motor axonal neuropathy, and absent reflexes. Although not an exact fit, the muscle weakness and neuropathic profile could align with forms of distal muscular atrophy."
