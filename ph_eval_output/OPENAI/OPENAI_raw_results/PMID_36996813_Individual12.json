      "disease_name": "Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Intracranial Hemorrhage, Seizures, and Spasticity",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:617573",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The phenotypic features closely match those found in the reference cases, such as hydrocephalus, thin corpus callosum, and intracranial hemorrhages, making this the most likely disease."

      "disease_name": "Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:225750",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This syndrome is associated with basal ganglia calcification, abnormal CNS myelination, and hydrocephalus. It's commonly characterized by intracranial calcifications, although systemic inflammatory responses might not be well aligned with the presented phenotypes."

    {
      "disease_name": "Cockayne Syndrome B",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:133540",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Cockayne Syndrome often involves CNS abnormalities such as hydrocephalus and microcephaly. The features match only partially with this patient, thus a lower rank."

    {
      "disease_name": "Porencephaly 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:175780",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Porencephalic cysts and lateral ventricle dilation are directly indicative of Porencephaly. However, this condition usually has more specific features compared to the current presentation."

    {
      "disease_name": "Van der Knaap Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:260600",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Van der Knaap syndrome involves dilated ventricles and abnormal myelination. It is a leukoencephalopathy which somewhat matches the presented CNS abnormalities."
