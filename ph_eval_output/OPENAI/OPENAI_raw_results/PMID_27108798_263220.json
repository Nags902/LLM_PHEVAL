      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms, including ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, intellectual disability, delayed motor milestones, hypotonia, and scoliosis, closely match those of the reference cases diagnosed with Spinocerebellar ataxia, autosomal recessive 20."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:213300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Joubert syndrome can present with similar phenotypes including ataxia, cerebellar hypoplasia, developmental delays, hypotonia, and visual impairment. The presence of cerebellar hypoplasia and the visual impairments align with this possibility."
