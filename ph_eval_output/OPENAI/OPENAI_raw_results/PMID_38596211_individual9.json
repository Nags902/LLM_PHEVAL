      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with axillary freckling, inguinal freckling, and few cafe-au-lait spots. These phenotypes strongly align with Neurofibromatosis type 1, as observed in similar reference cases."

      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome shares some phenotypic overlap with Neurofibromatosis type 1, including cafe-au-lait spots and freckling, but typically lacks neurofibromas. Given the 'few cafe-au-lait spots' and similar features, it is another potential condition."
