      "disease_id": "OMIM:607088",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's presentation closely matches the reference cases diagnosed with Neuronopathy, distal hereditary motor, autosomal dominant 11. Shared features include unsteady gait, lower limb amyotrophy, motor axonal neuropathy, impaired vibratory sensation, lower limb muscle weakness, and frequent falls."

      "disease_name": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal, type 2A2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:609260",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The phenotypic overlap such as motor axonal neuropathy, lower limb amyotrophy, impaired vibratory sensation, and gait instability raises the possibility of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, particularly the axonal type 2A2, although it diverges in some secondary features."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:601152",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "This condition can present with motor neuropathy, muscle weakness, and balance issues, similar to the patient's features, although it typically includes optic atrophy, which is not mentioned here."
