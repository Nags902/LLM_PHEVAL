      "disease_id": "OMIM:154700",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition features overlapping symptoms like arachnodactyly, scoliosis, and cardiovascular issues, although the absence of ectopia lentis and more classic skin/hyperextensibility symptoms makes this less likely than Contractural Arachnodactyly."
