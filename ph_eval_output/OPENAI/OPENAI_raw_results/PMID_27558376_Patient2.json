    {
      "disease_name": "Leukoencephalopathy with or without cerebellar ataxia and/or motor neuropathy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:616517",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotype matches well with reference cases exhibiting leukoencephalopathy, characterized by spastic paraparesis, sensorimotor neuropathy, cerebellar atrophy, and increased CSF lactate. The overlap in features including optic atrophy and cognitive impairment strongly correlates with this condition."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Adult-onset autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:109150",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The combination of features such as ataxia, apraxia, cerebellar atrophy, and progressive visual loss suggest ADCA as a potential diagnosis. Although the disease is more heterogeneous, it can present with similar phenotypic features in some subtypes."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Mitochondrial complex I deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:252010",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Given the presence of increased CSF lactate, cognitive impairment, and sensorimotor neuropathy alongside optic atrophy, a mitochondrial disorder such as complex I deficiency should be considered."

    {
      "disease_name": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:118210",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "CMT2A can present with sensorimotor neuropathy, optic atrophy, and spastic paraparesis. The phenotype partially overlaps, but the lack of hallmark features like pes cavus may reduce likelihood."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 29",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:165447",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Despite being less likely, the presence of ataxia, nystagmus, and cerebellar atrophy with similar features from reference cases suggests SCA29 as a possible, though lower-ranked, conclusion."
