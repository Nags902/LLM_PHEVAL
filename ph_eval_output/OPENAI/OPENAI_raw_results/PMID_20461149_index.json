      "disease_id": "OMIM:113620",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits many of the key features associated with Branchiooculofacial syndrome, including iris coloboma, retinal coloboma, microphthalmia, conductive hearing impairment, nasolacrimal duct obstruction, aplasia cutis congenita, and median pseudocleft lip. This aligns well with the phenotypes observed in the reference cases all diagnosed with this syndrome."

      "disease_name": "CHARGE syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:214800",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "CHARGE syndrome also often includes colobomas, hearing impairment, and facial anomalies, similar to the patient's features. However, the lack of other common CHARGE features such as heart defects or choanal atresia makes this less likely than Branchiooculofacial syndrome."

      "disease_name": "Oculocutaneous Albinism Type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:203100",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "The presence of vision issues and the skin abnormality (aplasia cutis congenita) might suggest a form of oculocutaneous albinism, though typical pigmentation issues are not noted, making it less fitting."
