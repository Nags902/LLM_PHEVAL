      "disease_id": "OMIM:614350",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's recurrent fractures, osteopenia, delayed motor development, proptosis, and diaphyseal undertubulation strongly overlap with the characteristics of Osteogenesis Imperfecta, Type IX, as seen in a similar reference case."

      "disease_name": "Osteogenesis Imperfecta, Type XV",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:615220",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The presence of osteopenia, recurrent fractures, motor delay, and pes planus in the patient aligns with features of Osteogenesis Imperfecta, Type XV. Similarities with reference case phenotypes, such as recurrent fractures and osteopenia, support this."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:259450",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "Bruck Syndrome can present with recurrent fractures, delayed motor development, and osteopenia, making it a plausible diagnosis."

      "explanation": "While this condition includes osteopenia and delayed motor development, the lack of other specific overlapping features makes this a less probable but possible diagnosis."
