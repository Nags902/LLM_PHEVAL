      "disease_name": "Mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, nuclear type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:220110",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The phenotypic features of this patient match closely with the similar reference cases (1 and 2), which were diagnosed with this condition. Key features such as EMG: myopathic abnormalities, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and metabolic acidosis point towards a mitochondrial condition."
    },

      "disease_name": "Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:540000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While not a perfect match, MELAS shares overlapping features with mitochondrial disorders such as metabolic acidosis, myopathy, and central nervous system manifestations, which can include hypotonia and abnormal facial features."

      "disease_name": "Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 1 (Hepatocerebral type)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:603041",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "This syndrome is a mitochondrial disorder similar to the reference cases and often presents with cardiomyopathy, myopathy, and metabolic abnormalities, although hyporeflexia and peripheral neuropathy are less common."
