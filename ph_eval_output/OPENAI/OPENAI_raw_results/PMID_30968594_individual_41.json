      "disease_name": "Adrenal hyperplasia, congenital, due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:201910",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features closely match reference cases that were diagnosed with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The key features such as decreased serum testosterone, increased ACTH, and increased prolactin align well with this condition."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Hypopituitarism",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:262600",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Hypopituitarism could lead to hormonal imbalances including altered testosterone, ACTH, and prolactin levels, but the lack of alterations in other cortisol-related phenotypic features makes it less likely than congenital adrenal hyperplasia."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Prolactinoma",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:102200",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Prolactinoma primarily causes increased prolactin levels and can lead to secondary hypogonadism with decreased testosterone. However, it is less likely given the increased ACTH is more indicative of adrenal involvement."
