      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Hyperuricemia is a key feature of this condition and aligns with similar reference cases exhibiting kidney disease and gout. The cases show progression to chronic kidney disease, suggesting a renal basis for the hyperuricemia."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:300322",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome is characterized by hyperuricemia due to a deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). It is relevant for consideration in young male patients with hyperuricemia."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:138900",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Gout is directly linked with hyperuricemia and can be considered due to its commonality. While less likely than a genetic disorder, it is a common cause of elevated uric acid levels."
