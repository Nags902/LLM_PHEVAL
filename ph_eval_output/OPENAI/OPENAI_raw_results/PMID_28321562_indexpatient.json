      "disease_id": "OMIM:606658",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This disease is strongly suggested by the presence of cerebellar vermis atrophy, spastic ataxia, dysarthria, and gait imbalance, which align with Case 2 and Case 3."

      "disease_name": "Spastic Paraplegia 7, Autosomal Recessive",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607259",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Considering the overlap with spastic features, including upper and lower limb spasticity and lower limb muscle weakness, similar to Case 1 which is a spastic paraplegia case."

      "disease_name": "Spastic Paraplegia 47, Autosomal Recessive",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613077",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "Characterized by spasticity, ataxia, and cerebellar features, aligning with the phenotypic presentation of spastic ataxia, dysarthria, and cerebellar vermis atrophy."

      "disease_name": "Friedreich Ataxia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:229300",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "While not identical, features such as gait instability, dysarthria, and ataxia overlap with Friedreich Ataxia, albeit with less specificity due to the lack of certain typical features like scoliosis or heart involvement."
