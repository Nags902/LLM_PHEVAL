      "disease_id": "OMIM:117360",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's clinical presentation, including aniridia, ataxia, hypotonia, nystagmus, delayed motor milestones, and cerebellar atrophy, closely matches the phenotypic features of spinocerebellar ataxia 29, as shown in the similar reference cases."

    {
      "disease_name": "WAGR syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:194072",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "WAGR syndrome can present with aniridia, intellectual disability, and variable other features, but lacks the specific combination of cerebellar atrophy and other neurological symptoms that correlate more closely with SCA29."

    {
      "disease_name": "Gillespie syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:206700",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Gillespie syndrome is characterized by aniridia and is associated with neurological abnormalities, but it is rarer than SCA29 and not as congruent with the specific phenotypic details, such as generalized hypotonia and cerebellar atrophy, seen in the patient."
