      "disease_id": "OMIM:105120",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The phenotypic features including amyloidosis of peripheral nerves and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea and constipation) strongly match the cases similar to hereditary systemic amyloidosis, a known condition associated with similar manifestations."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:176300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "TTR-FAP is associated with peripheral neuropathy and can also manifest with gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea and constipation. It is a hereditary systemic amyloidosis like hereditary systemic amyloidosis 6."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:105200",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "Although primary systemic amyloidosis is usually acquired rather than hereditary, it can involve peripheral nerves and gastrointestinal symptoms, suggesting it should be considered."
