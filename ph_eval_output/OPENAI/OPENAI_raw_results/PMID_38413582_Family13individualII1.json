      "disease_id": "OMIM:618757",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms and features closely match with the reference cases diagnosed with this disease, including difficulty climbing stairs, proximal and distal muscle weakness, highly elevated creatine kinase, calf muscle pseudohypertrophy, Gowers sign, and respiratory insufficiency."

    {
      "disease_name": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:310200",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition is characterized by many similar features such as early-onset muscle weakness, Gowers sign, calf pseudohypertrophy, and elevated CK levels. However, it is an X-linked disorder, and the patient's gender is unspecified."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Becker muscular dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300376",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Becker muscular dystrophy shares phenotypic overlaps with the patient's condition, such as muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase. It is less likely than Duchenne due to the specific pattern and severity of symptom onset."
