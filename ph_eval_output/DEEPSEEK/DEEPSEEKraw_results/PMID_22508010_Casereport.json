      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features closely match those of the similar reference cases, including hepatic steatosis, hepatomegaly, peripheral axonal neuropathy, and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions, which are hallmark signs of this syndrome."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:609260",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits distal muscle weakness, amyotrophy, and peripheral axonal neuropathy, which are common in this form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, though hepatic involvement is less typical."

      "disease_name": "Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:162400",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The patient's impaired distal tactile and vibratory sensation, along with peripheral neuropathy, are consistent with this condition, but the hepatic and mitochondrial findings are not typical."

      "explanation": "These disorders can present with mitochondrial DNA deletions, neuropathy, and hepatic involvement, but the specific phenotype may vary widely."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:603896",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "The hyperintensity of cerebral white matter on MRI is a feature, but the peripheral neuropathy and hepatic involvement are not typical for this condition."
