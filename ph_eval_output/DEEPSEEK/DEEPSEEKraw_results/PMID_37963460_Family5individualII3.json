      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits several features of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, including hypotonia, short stature, motor delay, and facial dysmorphism such as hypertelorism and high palate."

      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The patient's features such as short stature, hypertelorism, and motor delay are consistent with Cornelia de Lange syndrome, though some typical features like limb anomalies are not noted."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:606232",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "The patient's global developmental delay, hypotonia, and autistic behavior are suggestive of Phelan-McDermid syndrome, though the absence of seizures and more specific dysmorphic features lowers the rank."

      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "The patient's short stature, hypertelorism, and low-set ears are seen in Noonan syndrome, but the absence of cardiac defects and typical facial features reduces the likelihood."
