      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits classic features of Neurofibromatosis type 1, including neurofibroma, axillary and inguinal freckling, multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and Lisch nodules, which are all major diagnostic criteria for this condition."

      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome shares some features with Neurofibromatosis type 1, such as cafe-au-lait spots and axillary freckling, but typically lacks neurofibromas and Lisch nodules, making it less likely but still a consideration."

      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601321",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This rare syndrome combines features of Neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome. While the patient does not show Noonan syndrome features, it is a differential due to the overlapping Neurofibromatosis type 1 symptoms."

      "disease_name": "McCune-Albright syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "McCune-Albright syndrome can present with cafe-au-lait spots, but it is typically associated with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and endocrine abnormalities, which are not mentioned in the patient's features."
