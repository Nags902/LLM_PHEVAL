      "explanation": "The patient's features closely match those of the reference cases, all of which were diagnosed with familial partial lipodystrophy type 2. Key features include lipodystrophy, type II diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hepatic steatosis."

      "explanation": "This type also presents with lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities, but the reference cases and the patient's phenotype are more consistent with type 2."
