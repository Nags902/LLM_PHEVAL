      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features, including anemia, short stature, increased mean corpuscular volume, elevated red cell adenosine deaminase activity, and persistence of hemoglobin F, closely match the phenotypic profile of Diamond-Blackfan anemia 1, as seen in the similar reference cases."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Diamond-Blackfan anemia 2 shares many features with type 1, including anemia and elevated red cell adenosine deaminase activity, but is less commonly associated with the full spectrum of the patient's symptoms."
