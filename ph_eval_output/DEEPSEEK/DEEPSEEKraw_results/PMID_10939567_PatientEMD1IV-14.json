      "disease_name": "Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 2, autosomal dominant",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:181350",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features closely match those of the reference cases, including Achilles tendon contracture, gait disturbance, spinal rigidity, arrhythmia, scapuloperoneal amyotrophy, proximal muscle weakness in upper limbs, and stiff neck, all of which are hallmark symptoms of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 2."

      "disease_name": "Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 1, X-linked",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:310300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This X-linked form of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy shares many features with the autosomal dominant form, including contractures, muscle weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias, but the patient's gender (female) makes this less likely than the autosomal dominant form."

    {
      "disease_name": "Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:159001",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This type of muscular dystrophy can present with proximal muscle weakness and arrhythmias, but the presence of contractures and scapuloperoneal amyotrophy is more characteristic of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Myotonic dystrophy type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:160900",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Myotonic dystrophy can present with muscle weakness and arrhythmias, but it typically includes myotonia and other systemic features not mentioned in this patient's phenotype."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:158900",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This condition often involves scapular muscle weakness and can have distal involvement, but the presence of contractures and cardiac arrhythmias is unusual and points more toward Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy."
