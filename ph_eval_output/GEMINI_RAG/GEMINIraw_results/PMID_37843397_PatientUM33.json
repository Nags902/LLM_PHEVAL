      "disease_id": "OMIM:151660",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's full set of phenotypic features, including Type II diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue in limbs and trunk (lipodystrophy), hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hepatic steatosis, precisely matches the clinical presentation of Lipodystrophy, familial partial, type 2 (FPLD2). This is further strongly supported by all three provided reference cases, which exhibit highly similar symptom profiles and were definitively diagnosed with FPLD2, making it the most probable causative disease."

      "disease_name": "Lipodystrophy, familial partial, type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:608933",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While FPLD2 is the primary candidate, other forms of familial partial lipodystrophy, such as FPLD1, can also present with overlapping metabolic complications including insulin resistance, type II diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. Although the specific genetic causes and fat distribution patterns may differ, it remains a relevant differential diagnosis given the overarching lipodystrophy phenotype and severe metabolic derangements."

      "disease_name": "Lipodystrophy, congenital generalized, type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:269700",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy, Type 2 (CGL2), is considered a less likely but possible differential diagnosis. CGLs are characterized by severe, often near-total, generalized fat loss and profound metabolic complications such as severe insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatic steatosis. However, the patient's specific description of 'partial' fat loss predominantly in limbs and trunk makes a partial lipodystrophy more consistent with the presented phenotype."
