      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This disease is the most likely diagnosis given the presence of all three key phenotypic features: plexiform neurofibroma, multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and freckling. These features are primary diagnostic criteria for NF1. The provided similar reference cases, all diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis, type 1 based on an identical or highly similar phenotypic presentation, strongly support this conclusion."

      "disease_name": "Legius Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611490",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius Syndrome is considered a differential diagnosis as it shares common cutaneous features with NF1, such as multiple cafe-au-lait spots and freckling. However, a crucial distinguishing factor and the reason for its lower rank is the typical absence of neurofibromas (including plexiform neurofibromas) and Lisch nodules, both of which are central to the patient's presentation (specifically, plexiform neurofibroma). While less likely given the full phenotype, it's a relevant differential for conditions mimicking NF1's skin findings."

      "disease_name": "Constitutional Mismatch Repair Deficiency (CMMRD)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:617947",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "CMMRD can present with multiple cafe-au-lait spots and freckling, thus mimicking some of the cutaneous manifestations of NF1. However, CMMRD is primarily characterized by a high risk of early-onset malignancies (e.g., brain tumors, hematological, and gastrointestinal cancers) and importantly, does not typically involve the formation of neurofibromas, including plexiform neurofibromas, which are a prominent feature in the patient's phenotype. Its ranking is significantly lower due to this key missing feature."
