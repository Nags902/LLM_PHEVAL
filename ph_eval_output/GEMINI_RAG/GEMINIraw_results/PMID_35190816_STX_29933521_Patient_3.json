      "disease_id": "OMIM:613721",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This disease is directly linked to 'Infantile spasms' (synonymous with Epileptic spasm) and 'Epileptic encephalopathy' in two of the provided similar reference cases (Case 2 and Case 3), making it a very strong candidate."

      "disease_name": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 4",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:612164",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This disease is directly linked to 'Epileptic spasm' in one of the provided similar reference cases (Case 1), making it a highly relevant candidate."

    {
      "disease_name": "West Syndrome, X-linked",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "West Syndrome is a clinical diagnosis defined by the presence of epileptic spasms (infantile spasms), developmental regression, and often hypsarrhythmia. Many underlying developmental and epileptic encephalopathies manifest as West Syndrome. The X-linked form is particularly relevant given the patient's male gender."

      "disease_name": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613254",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex is one of the most common identifiable causes of symptomatic infantile spasms, and TSC2 is frequently associated with neurological manifestations including seizures. It is a critical differential diagnosis for this phenotype."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:191100",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Similar to TSC2, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1 is also a well-known cause of symptomatic infantile spasms. Both types are important to consider when epileptic spasms are present."

      "disease_name": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, CDKL5-related",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300672",
      "score": 0.166,
      "explanation": "CDKL5 deficiency disorder is a significant genetic cause of early-onset epileptic encephalopathy with prominent infantile spasms, affecting both genders although often more severely in females."

    {
      "disease_name": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300673",
      "score": 0.142,
      "explanation": "This disease, caused by ARX gene mutations, is known to cause severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathies, including Ohtahara syndrome and West syndrome, characterized by various seizure types including infantile spasms, particularly in males."
