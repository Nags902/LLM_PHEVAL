      "disease_id": "OMIM:614816",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features closely match those of the similar reference cases, including high palate, abnormal sternum morphology, arachnodactyly, aortic root aneurysm, arterial tortuosity, and dural ectasia, which are hallmark signs of Loeys-Dietz syndrome 4."

    {
      "disease_name": "Marfan syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:154700",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits several features consistent with Marfan syndrome such as arachnodactyly, mitral valve prolapse, aortic root aneurysm, and dural ectasia. However, the absence of ectopia lentis and other specific features makes it less likely than Loeys-Dietz syndrome 4."

      "disease_name": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:130050",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The patient has arterial tortuosity, aortic root aneurysm, and striae distensae, which are seen in vascular EDS. However, the absence of skin hyperextensibility and other typical features reduces its likelihood."

      "disease_name": "Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:182212",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This syndrome shares features like tall stature, arachnodactyly, and aortic root aneurysm. However, the absence of craniosynostosis and other specific findings makes it less likely."

    {
      "disease_name": "Homocystinuria",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:236200",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Arachnodactyly and tall stature can be seen in homocystinuria, but the absence of intellectual disability and thromboembolic events reduces its likelihood."
