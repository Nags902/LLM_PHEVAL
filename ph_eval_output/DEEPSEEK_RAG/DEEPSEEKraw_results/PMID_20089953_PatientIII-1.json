      "disease_id": "OMIM:259440",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features such as osteopenia, recurrent fractures, delayed gross motor development, proptosis, pes planus, and diaphyseal undertubulation closely match the phenotypic features seen in Osteogenesis imperfecta, type IX, as seen in the similar reference case."

      "disease_name": "Osteogenesis imperfecta, type XV",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:615220",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient's osteopenia, recurrent fractures, delayed gross motor development, and proptosis are consistent with features seen in Osteogenesis imperfecta, type XV, though some features like dentinogenesis imperfecta and blue sclerae are not mentioned."

      "disease_name": "Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Guo-Campeau type",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:618728",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "While the patient shares some features like osteopenia and delayed gross motor development with this condition, many of the other features such as severe intrauterine growth retardation and craniofacial abnormalities are not present."

      "disease_name": "Osteogenesis imperfecta, type III",

      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "The patient's recurrent fractures, osteopenia, and delayed motor development are consistent with Osteogenesis imperfecta, type III, though other features like severe bone deformities are not noted."

      "disease_name": "Osteogenesis imperfecta, type IV",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:166220",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "The patient's features such as osteopenia and recurrent fractures could align with Osteogenesis imperfecta, type IV, but the absence of dentinogenesis imperfecta and milder skeletal involvement lowers its rank."
