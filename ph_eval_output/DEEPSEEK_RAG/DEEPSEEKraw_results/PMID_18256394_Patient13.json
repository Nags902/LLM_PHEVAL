      "disease_name": "Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:176670",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features closely match those of the reference cases, all of which were diagnosed with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria. Key overlapping features include proptosis, hypermetropia, high palate, failure to thrive, lipodystrophy, short stature, prolonged QT interval, delayed eruption of teeth, shark teeth, circumoral cyanosis, micrognathia, alopecia, mottled pigmentation, reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue, prominent superficial blood vessels, reduced bone mineral density, and ankyloglossia."

      "disease_name": "Mandibuloacral Dysplasia with Type A Lipodystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:248370",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition shares several features with the patient's presentation, including lipodystrophy, short stature, delayed eruption of teeth, micrognathia, alopecia, mottled pigmentation, reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue, and reduced bone mineral density. However, it lacks some of the cardiovascular and ocular features seen in the patient."

      "disease_name": "Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:264090",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This progeroid syndrome includes features such as failure to thrive, lipodystrophy, short stature, delayed eruption of teeth, micrognathia, alopecia, and reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, it does not typically include proptosis, hypermetropia, or prolonged QT interval."

    {
      "disease_name": "Cockayne Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:216400",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Cockayne syndrome can present with failure to thrive, short stature, delayed eruption of teeth, micrognathia, alopecia, mottled pigmentation, and reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, it is less likely due to the absence of key features like lipodystrophy and prolonged QT interval, and the presence of photosensitivity is not noted in the patient."

    {
      "disease_name": "Restrictive Dermopathy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:275210",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This condition shares some features such as failure to thrive, micrognathia, and reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, it is typically lethal in the neonatal period and does not match many of the patient's features like proptosis, hypermetropia, or prolonged QT interval."
