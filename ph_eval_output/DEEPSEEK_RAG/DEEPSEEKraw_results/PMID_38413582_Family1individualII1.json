    {
      "disease_name": "Muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, autosomal recessive 29",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:618771",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features closely match those of the similar reference cases, all of which were diagnosed with this condition. Key features include proximal and distal muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase, calf muscle pseudohypertrophy, and Gowers sign."

    {
      "disease_name": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:310200",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition shares many features with the patient's presentation, such as proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase, and Gowers sign. However, the presence of distal muscle weakness and pain insensitivity is less typical."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Becker muscular dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300376",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy but with a milder phenotype. The patient's features could align with this condition, though distal weakness and pain insensitivity are less common."

    {
      "disease_name": "Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:310300",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This condition is characterized by muscle weakness, joint contractures, and cardiac involvement. The patient's joint contractures and muscle weakness are consistent, but pain insensitivity is not a typical feature."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Congenital muscular dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:604801",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This group of disorders includes phenotypes with muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase, and joint contractures. The patient's features could fit, but the specific subtype would need further investigation."
