      "disease_id": "OMIM:616900",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features closely match those of the similar reference cases, all of which were diagnosed with this condition. Key overlapping features include absent speech, motor delay, global developmental delay, profound intellectual disability, hyporeflexia, seizures, generalized hypotonia, cerebral visual impairment, tube feeding, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia."

      "explanation": "This syndrome shares several features with the patient's presentation, including absent speech, motor delay, global developmental delay, profound intellectual disability, seizures, generalized hypotonia, and high palate. However, it lacks some of the metabolic features like hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia."
