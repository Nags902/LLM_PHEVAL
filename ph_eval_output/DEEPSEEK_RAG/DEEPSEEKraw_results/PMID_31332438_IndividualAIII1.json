      "disease_id": "OMIM:619121",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features closely match those of the similar reference cases, all of which were diagnosed with this condition. Key matching features include motor axonal neuropathy, lower limb amyotrophy, impaired vibratory sensation, and frequent falls."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:601472",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This disease also presents with motor axonal neuropathy and lower limb muscle weakness, though the absence of upper limb symptoms in the patient makes it less likely than the top candidate."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:201300",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This condition can present with impaired vibratory sensation and motor neuropathy, but the lack of autonomic symptoms in the patient reduces its likelihood."

      "disease_name": "Spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:158600",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This disease involves lower limb muscle weakness and amyotrophy, but the presence of motor axonal neuropathy in the patient is more indicative of a neuropathy than a primary muscular atrophy."
