      "disease_name": "Fanconi anemia, complementation group C",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:227645",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features, including chromosomal breakage induced by crosslinking agents, absent thumb, absent radius, short stature, cafe-au-lait spots, and pancytopenia, closely match the phenotypic profile of Fanconi anemia, complementation group C, as seen in the similar reference cases."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Fanconi anemia, complementation group A",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:227650",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Fanconi anemia, complementation group A shares many features with group C, including chromosomal breakage, skeletal abnormalities, and hematologic manifestations. The patient's phenotype could also align with this subtype, though the reference cases point more strongly toward group C."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Fanconi anemia, complementation group G",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:614082",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This subtype of Fanconi anemia also presents with chromosomal instability, skeletal anomalies, and hematologic defects. While less directly supported by the reference cases, it remains a plausible consideration given the patient's features."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Dyskeratosis congenita",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:305000",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Dyskeratosis congenita can present with bone marrow failure, short stature, and skin pigmentation changes. However, the absence of classic features like nail dystrophy or leukoplakia and the presence of radial anomalies make it a less likely diagnosis compared to Fanconi anemia."

    {
      "disease_name": "Nijmegen breakage syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:251260",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This syndrome involves chromosomal breakage and growth retardation, but it typically includes microcephaly and immunodeficiency, which are not mentioned in the patient's features, making it a lower-ranked possibility."
