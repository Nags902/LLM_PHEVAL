      "disease_id": "OMIM:615502",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features closely match those in the similar reference cases, including intellectual disability, global developmental delay, feeding difficulties, microcephaly, and thick eyebrows. The phenotypic overlap is significant, making this the most likely diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Coffin-Siris syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:135900",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits features such as intellectual disability, global developmental delay, thick eyebrows, and triangular face, which are common in Coffin-Siris syndrome. However, the absence of some hallmark features like hypoplastic nails reduces the likelihood."

      "disease_name": "Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:180849",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The patient's features such as intellectual disability, thick eyebrows, and microcephaly are seen in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, the absence of broad thumbs and toes decreases the likelihood."

      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "The patient's triangular face and short stature are consistent with Noonan syndrome, but the absence of cardiac anomalies and typical facial features reduces the likelihood."

      "disease_name": "Williams syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:194050",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "The patient's intellectual disability and motor delay are seen in Williams syndrome, but the absence of cardiovascular anomalies and elfin facies makes this diagnosis less likely."
