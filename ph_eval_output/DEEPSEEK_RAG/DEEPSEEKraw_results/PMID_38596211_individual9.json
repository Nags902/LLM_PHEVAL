      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis, type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with axillary freckling, inguinal freckling, and few cafe-au-lait spots, which are hallmark features of Neurofibromatosis type 1. The similar reference cases also support this diagnosis."

    {
      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome shares some phenotypic features with Neurofibromatosis type 1, such as cafe-au-lait spots and freckling, but typically lacks neurofibromas. This is a less likely diagnosis but still possible given the patient's features."

      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines can present with freckling and cafe-au-lait spots, but it is less likely given the absence of other characteristic features such as cardiac anomalies or facial dysmorphism."

    {
      "disease_name": "McCune-Albright syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "McCune-Albright syndrome can present with cafe-au-lait spots, but the freckling and absence of other features like polyostotic fibrous dysplasia make this a less likely diagnosis."
