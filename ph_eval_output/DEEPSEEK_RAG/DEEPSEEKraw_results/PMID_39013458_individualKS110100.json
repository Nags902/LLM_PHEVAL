      "disease_id": "OMIM:610253",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features such as tube feeding, intellectual disability, global developmental delay, chronic constipation, talipes equinovarus, hypermetropia, depression, anxiety, developmental regression, and microcephaly closely match the phenotypic spectrum of Kleefstra syndrome 1, as seen in the similar reference case."

      "disease_name": "Intellectual developmental disorder with autism and macrocephaly",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:615032",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Although the patient does not have macrocephaly, the presence of intellectual disability, global developmental delay, and other neurodevelopmental features overlap with this disorder. The absence of macrocephaly reduces the likelihood but does not rule it out entirely."

    {
      "disease_name": "Pitt-Hopkins syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:610954",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The patient's features like intellectual disability, global developmental delay, chronic constipation, talipes equinovarus, and microcephaly are consistent with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome. However, the absence of characteristic facial features and breathing abnormalities lowers its rank."

    {
      "disease_name": "Rett syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312750",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "The developmental regression and microcephaly are suggestive of Rett syndrome, but the absence of hand stereotypies and gender (male) make it less likely, as Rett syndrome is predominantly seen in females."

    {
      "disease_name": "Angelman syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:105830",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "The patient's intellectual disability, developmental delay, and microcephaly are seen in Angelman syndrome, but the absence of seizures, happy demeanor, and ataxia reduces its likelihood."
