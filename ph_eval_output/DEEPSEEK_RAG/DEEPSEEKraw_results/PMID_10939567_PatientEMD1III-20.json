      "disease_id": "OMIM:181350",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features closely match those of the reference cases, including difficulty running, waddling gait, loss of ambulation, Achilles tendon contracture, elbow contracture, spinal rigidity, elevated creatine kinase, ventricular arrhythmia, abnormal left ventricular function, scapuloperoneal amyotrophy, proximal muscle weakness in upper limbs, and stiff neck."

      "disease_name": "Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 1B",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:159001",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This disease shares some features with the patient's condition, such as proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase, and cardiac involvement, but lacks the specific contractures and scapuloperoneal amyotrophy seen in the patient."

      "disease_name": "Myofibrillar myopathy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601419",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Myofibrillar myopathy can present with muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase, and cardiac involvement, but the contractures and scapuloperoneal amyotrophy are less typical."

      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This disease can present with scapular weakness and proximal muscle weakness, but the contractures, spinal rigidity, and cardiac involvement are not typical features."
