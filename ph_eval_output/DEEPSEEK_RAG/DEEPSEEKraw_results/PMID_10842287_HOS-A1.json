      "disease_id": "OMIM:142900",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features of atrial septal defect, absent thumb, and upper limb phocomelia closely match the phenotypic spectrum of Holt-Oram syndrome, as seen in the similar reference cases provided."

      "disease_name": "Thrombocytopenia-Absent Radius (TAR) syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:274000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "TAR syndrome can present with absent thumbs and upper limb anomalies, though it typically includes thrombocytopenia, which is not mentioned here. The absence of thrombocytopenia lowers its likelihood."

      "disease_name": "VACTERL association",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:192350",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "VACTERL association can include limb anomalies and cardiac defects, but it typically involves multiple other features (vertebral, anal, tracheoesophageal, renal) not mentioned here, making it less likely."

      "explanation": "Fanconi anemia can present with thumb and radial anomalies, but it usually includes other features like bone marrow failure and increased cancer risk, which are not mentioned here."
