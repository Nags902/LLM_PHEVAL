      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features such as hypertelorism, ptosis, downslanted palpebral fissures, low-set ears, short neck, low posterior hairline, cardiomyopathy, and cafe-au-lait spots are highly consistent with Noonan syndrome. The similar reference cases also strongly suggest this diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:605275",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This subtype of Noonan syndrome shares many features with the patient's presentation, including hypertelorism, ptosis, and cardiomyopathy. The similar reference cases were diagnosed with Noonan syndrome 2, making it a strong candidate."

      "disease_name": "LEOPARD syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "LEOPARD syndrome shares features such as hypertelorism, ptosis, cardiomyopathy, and cafe-au-lait spots with the patient's presentation. However, the absence of lentigines makes this less likely than Noonan syndrome."

      "disease_name": "Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:115150",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This condition overlaps with Noonan syndrome in features like hypertelorism, ptosis, and cardiomyopathy, but the patient lacks some typical features such as sparse hair and skin abnormalities, making it less likely."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Costello syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:218040",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Costello syndrome can present with hypertelorism, ptosis, and cardiomyopathy, but the patient lacks characteristic features like deep palmar creases and papillomata, reducing its likelihood."
