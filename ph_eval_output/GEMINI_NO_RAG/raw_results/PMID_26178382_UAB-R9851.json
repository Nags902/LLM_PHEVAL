      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This syndrome, also known as LEOPARD syndrome, is a strong candidate as it characteristically presents with multiple lentigines (a form of freckling) and pulmonic stenosis, which are two of the patient's key features. While multiple cafe-au-lait spots are not primary diagnostic features, they can be observed in some individuals with this condition, fitting all three reported phenotypic features."

    {
      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is highly characterized by multiple cafe-au-lait spots and freckling (e.g., axillary and inguinal freckling, Crowe's sign), perfectly matching two of the patient's features. Although pulmonic stenosis is less common and not a major diagnostic criterion for NF1, congenital heart defects including valvular abnormalities can occur, making it a plausible differential diagnosis."

    {
      "disease_name": "Legius Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome is characterized by multiple cafe-au-lait spots and axillary/inguinal freckling, closely mimicking the skin manifestations of Neurofibromatosis Type 1. However, it typically lacks neurofibromas and Lisch nodules. Pulmonic stenosis is not a characteristic feature of Legius syndrome, making it a less likely candidate compared to the top two, but still worth considering due to the prominent skin findings."
