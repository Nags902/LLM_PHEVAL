      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Muir-Torre Syndrome is a variant of Lynch Syndrome characterized by the occurrence of sebaceous neoplasms and keratoacanthomas (a type of self-healing squamous epithelioma), often along with internal malignancies. Its strong association with keratoacanthomas makes it a significant differential diagnosis for the presented phenotype."
