      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with increased bone mineral density, thickened cortex of long bones, and thickened calvaria, which are hallmark features of osteopetrosis. The autosomal dominant form can also present with developmental delay and facial dysmorphisms like hypertelorism and depressed nasal bridge."

      "explanation": "Pyknodysostosis is characterized by increased bone density, thickened calvaria, and facial dysmorphisms including hypertelorism and depressed nasal bridge. The sandwich appearance of vertebral bodies and developmental delay can also be seen in this condition."
