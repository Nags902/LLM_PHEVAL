      "disease_name": "Rett Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312750",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Rett Syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects females and is characterized by developmental regression, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and often includes anxiety and depression. The presence of developmental regression and microcephaly strongly suggests this condition."

      "disease_name": "Angelman Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:105830",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Angelman Syndrome is associated with intellectual disability, developmental delay, microcephaly, and often includes anxiety and happy demeanor. However, the absence of a happy demeanor and the presence of developmental regression make it less likely than Rett Syndrome."

      "disease_name": "Prader-Willi Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:176270",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Prader-Willi Syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, and chronic constipation. However, the absence of hyperphagia and the presence of microcephaly and developmental regression make it less likely."

      "disease_name": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:270400",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome includes intellectual disability, developmental delay, microcephaly, and talipes equinovarus. The presence of these features makes it a possible candidate, but the lack of cholesterol metabolism issues in the patient's features reduces its likelihood."

    {
      "disease_name": "Cri-du-Chat Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:123450",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Cri-du-Chat Syndrome is marked by intellectual disability, microcephaly, and developmental delay. However, the absence of the characteristic cat-like cry and the presence of developmental regression make it less likely."
