      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder that matches many of the patient's features, including arachnodactyly, tall stature, mitral valve prolapse, aortic root aneurysm, dural ectasia, and striae distensae."

      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can present with arterial tortuosity, aortic root aneurysm, and other connective tissue abnormalities, though it is less likely than Marfan or Loeys-Dietz syndromes given the patient's features."
