      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms of global developmental delay, increased circulating lactate concentration, hypoglycemia, and hypotonia are highly indicative of a mitochondrial disorder, specifically mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency, which affects fatty acid oxidation."

      "disease_name": "Glycogen storage disease type Ia (von Gierke disease)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:232200",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Hypoglycemia and increased lactate levels are hallmark features of glycogen storage disease type Ia, which also presents with developmental delay and hypotonia due to impaired glucose metabolism."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:312170",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This disorder is characterized by lactic acidosis, developmental delay, and hypotonia, aligning with the patient's symptoms, though coagulation abnormalities are less commonly associated."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:212065",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This multisystem disorder can present with developmental delay, hypotonia, and coagulation abnormalities, though hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis are less prominent features."

      "disease_name": "Maple syrup urine disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:248600",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "While this disorder typically presents with metabolic acidosis and developmental delay, the presence of hypoglycemia and hypotonia could be consistent, though coagulation abnormalities are not typical."
