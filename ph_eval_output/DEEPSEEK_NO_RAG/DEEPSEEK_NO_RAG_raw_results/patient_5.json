      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with glutaric aciduria, macrocephaly, cerebral atrophy, and dystonia, which are hallmark features of Glutaric Aciduria Type 1. Subdural hemorrhage can also occur due to the associated cerebral atrophy and vascular fragility."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:236792",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition can present with macrocephaly, cerebral atrophy, and dystonia. Although glutaric aciduria is not a typical feature, the overlap in other symptoms warrants consideration."

      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Canavan Disease is characterized by macrocephaly and cerebral atrophy. While dystonia and subdural hemorrhage are less common, the presence of macrocephaly and cerebral atrophy makes it a possible differential."

      "explanation": "Methylmalonic Acidemia can present with dystonia and cerebral atrophy. Although glutaric aciduria and macrocephaly are not typical, the metabolic disturbance could contribute to some of the observed symptoms."
