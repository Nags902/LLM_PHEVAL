      "disease_id": "OMIM:610743",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with gait ataxia and delayed ability to walk, which are hallmark features of spinocerebellar ataxia. The intellectual disability and global developmental delay further support this diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Angelman syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:105830",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Angelman syndrome is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and delayed speech, which match the patient's symptoms. However, gait ataxia is less commonly a primary feature."

      "disease_name": "Rett syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312750",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Rett syndrome can present with global developmental delay and delayed speech, but it is more commonly seen in females. The presence of gait ataxia is less typical."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:208900",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Ataxia-telangiectasia includes gait ataxia and delayed motor development, but it typically presents with telangiectasias and immunodeficiency, which are not mentioned here."

      "disease_name": "Fragile X syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300624",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Fragile X syndrome is associated with intellectual disability and delayed speech, but gait ataxia is not a common feature, making it a less likely match."
