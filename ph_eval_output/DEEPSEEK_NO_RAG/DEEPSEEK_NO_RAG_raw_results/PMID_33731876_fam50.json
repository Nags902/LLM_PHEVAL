      "explanation": "The patient exhibits multiple seizure types (focal tonic, generalized tonic, generalized myoclonic), hypsarrhythmia, and intellectual disability, which are hallmark features of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Dravet Syndrome is characterized by severe myoclonic seizures, multifocal epileptiform discharges, and intellectual disability, though it typically starts in infancy and may not fully explain all features like hypsarrhythmia."

      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Angelman Syndrome presents with severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, and seizures, including myoclonic and tonic seizures, but lacks some of the specific EEG patterns like hypsarrhythmia."
