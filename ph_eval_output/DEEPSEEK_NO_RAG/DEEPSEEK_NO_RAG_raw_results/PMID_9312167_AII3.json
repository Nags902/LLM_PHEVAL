      "disease_id": "OMIM:602722",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with distal renal tubular acidosis, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis, which are hallmark features of this condition. Hypokalemia and impaired renal concentrating ability are also commonly associated."

      "disease_name": "Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:259900",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition can present with nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis due to excessive oxalate production. While distal renal tubular acidosis is not a primary feature, secondary tubular damage could occur."

      "disease_name": "Bartter Syndrome Type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601678",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Bartter syndrome can present with hypokalemia and nephrocalcinosis. However, the presence of distal renal tubular acidosis is less common, making this a less likely diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601198",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This condition can cause nephrocalcinosis and hypokalemia due to calcium deposition in the kidneys. However, distal renal tubular acidosis is not a typical feature."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:300009",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Dent disease can present with nephrolithiasis and impaired renal concentrating ability. However, distal renal tubular acidosis and hypokalemia are less commonly associated."
