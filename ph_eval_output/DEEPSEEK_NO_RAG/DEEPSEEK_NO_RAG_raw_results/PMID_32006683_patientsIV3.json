      "disease_name": "Marfan Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:154700",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits several features consistent with Marfan Syndrome, including tall stature, arachnodactyly, joint hypermobility, pectus excavatum, scoliosis, and high myopia. The presence of ectopia lentis, a common feature in Marfan Syndrome, is not noted, but other connective tissue manifestations like hernias and diverticula are present."

    {
      "disease_name": "Loeys-Dietz Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:609192",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Loeys-Dietz Syndrome shares many features with Marfan Syndrome, including tall stature, arachnodactyly, and pectus excavatum. The patient's features like telecanthus, downslanted palpebral fissures, and high palate are more typical of Loeys-Dietz Syndrome. The presence of congenital diaphragmatic hernia and diverticula also supports this diagnosis."

    {
      "disease_name": "Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Classical Type",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:130000",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The patient's joint hypermobility, inguinal hernia, and skin features (though not explicitly mentioned) could suggest Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. However, the absence of significant skin hyperextensibility or fragility makes this less likely than Marfan or Loeys-Dietz syndromes."

    {
      "disease_name": "Shprintzen-Goldberg Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:182212",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This syndrome overlaps with Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes, featuring craniosynostosis, marfanoid habitus, and skeletal anomalies. The patient's features like long face, high palate, and ptosis could fit, but the absence of craniosynostosis makes this less likely."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Homocystinuria",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:236200",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Homocystinuria can present with marfanoid habitus, tall stature, and skeletal abnormalities. However, the lack of intellectual disability or thromboembolic events in the patient's history reduces the likelihood of this diagnosis."
