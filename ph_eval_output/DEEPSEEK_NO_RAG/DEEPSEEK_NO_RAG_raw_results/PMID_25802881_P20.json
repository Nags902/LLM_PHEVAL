      "explanation": "Subcutaneous ossification is a hallmark feature of this disease, and intellectual disability can occasionally be present. Elevated parathyroid hormone levels may occur due to secondary hyperparathyroidism from calcium metabolism disturbances."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Elevated circulating parathyroid hormone level is a key feature due to resistance to PTH. Intellectual disability is common, and subcutaneous ossifications can occur as part of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy."

      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Characterized by subcutaneous ossification, and while intellectual disability is not typically a feature, it can rarely occur. Elevated PTH levels are not a common feature but could be secondary."
