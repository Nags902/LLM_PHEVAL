      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features, including focal seizures, intellectual disability, and autistic behavior, are highly consistent with PCDH19-related epilepsy, which often presents with seizures and developmental delays."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:300215",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The presence of gray matter heterotopia, seizures, and developmental delay aligns with ARX-related disorders, though the patient lacks some typical features like lissencephaly."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:300672",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The patient's seizures, developmental delay, and autistic behavior are seen in CDKL5 deficiency disorder, but the absence of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy may lower its likelihood."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:613454",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "The patient's features, such as seizures, developmental delay, and motor stereotypies, overlap with FOXG1 syndrome, though cortical atrophy is less commonly reported."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "The patient's intellectual disability, seizures, and autistic behavior are consistent with MECP2 duplication syndrome, but the absence of recurrent infections or hypotonia may reduce its likelihood."
