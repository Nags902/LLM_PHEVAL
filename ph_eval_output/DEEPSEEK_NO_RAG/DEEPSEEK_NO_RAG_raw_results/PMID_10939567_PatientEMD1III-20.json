      "disease_id": "OMIM:310300",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms, including proximal muscle weakness, contractures (Achilles tendon and elbow), spinal rigidity, and ventricular arrhythmia, are highly consistent with Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy. The X-linked inheritance pattern is also suggested by the male gender of the patient."

      "disease_name": "Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy, Type 1B",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:159001",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This subtype of LGMD can present with proximal muscle weakness, elevated CK levels, and cardiac involvement, which matches some of the patient's features. However, contractures are less common in this subtype."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:158900",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "FSHD can present with scapular weakness and proximal upper limb weakness, but the presence of contractures and cardiac involvement makes this less likely."

      "explanation": "This condition can present with muscle weakness, elevated CK, and cardiac involvement, but the pattern of weakness and contractures is less typical."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:158810",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Bethlem Myopathy is characterized by contractures and muscle weakness, but cardiac involvement is rare, making it a less likely candidate."
