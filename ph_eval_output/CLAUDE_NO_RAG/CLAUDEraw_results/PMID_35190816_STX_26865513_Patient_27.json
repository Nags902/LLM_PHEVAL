      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "ARX mutations cause X-linked intellectual disability with epilepsy, featuring multiple seizure types, gray matter heterotopia, moderate intellectual disability, and autistic behaviors. The combination of structural brain abnormalities and epileptic encephalopathy strongly suggests this diagnosis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:300088",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "PCDH19 mutations cause epileptic encephalopathy with multiple seizure types, intellectual disability, and autistic features. While it doesn't typically cause gray matter heterotopia, the seizure profile and behavioral phenotype are consistent."

      "disease_name": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:191100",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "TSC1 mutations can cause epilepsy (including focal seizures), intellectual disability, autism, and cortical malformations. While gray matter heterotopia is less common than cortical tubers, the overall phenotype is compatible."

      "disease_name": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613254",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "TSC2 mutations present similarly to TSC1 with epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism. The cortical atrophy and seizure semiology are consistent, though gray matter heterotopia is atypical."

      "disease_name": "Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 2 (CDKL5-related)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300672",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "CDKL5 deficiency disorder causes early-onset epilepsy with multiple seizure types, severe developmental delay, and motor stereotypies. The moderate intellectual disability and specific brain malformation are less typical."

      "disease_name": "Lissencephaly 1 (LIS1-related)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607432",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "LIS1 mutations can cause gray matter heterotopia, epilepsy, and intellectual disability. However, the specific seizure types and behavioral phenotype are less characteristic of classical lissencephaly."
