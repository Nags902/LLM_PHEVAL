      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy characterized by burst suppression on EEG, tonic spasms, severe intellectual disability, and cerebral atrophy. The phenotype matches perfectly with the patient's presentation."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:612164",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "STXBP1 mutations cause epileptic encephalopathy with infantile spasms, burst suppression, severe intellectual disability, and cerebral atrophy. Very similar to Ohtahara syndrome phenotype."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:300672",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "CDKL5 deficiency causes early-onset seizures including infantile spasms, myoclonic seizures, severe intellectual disability, though burst suppression is less common."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:300088",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "PCDH19-related epilepsy can present with epileptic encephalopathy, infantile spasms, and intellectual disability, though typically affects females and burst suppression is rare."

      "explanation": "ARX mutations can cause infantile spasms, epileptic encephalopathy with burst suppression, and severe intellectual disability, particularly in males."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.167,
      "explanation": "Classic triad of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and developmental regression. While burst suppression is not typical, it can evolve from Ohtahara syndrome."
