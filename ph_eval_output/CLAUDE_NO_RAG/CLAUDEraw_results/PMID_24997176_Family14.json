      "explanation": "LCA is characterized by severe visual impairment from birth, nystagmus, and eye poking (oculodigital sign). The very low visual acuity and hypermetropia are consistent with this diagnosis in a 2-year-old."

      "explanation": "Another subtype of LCA with similar presentation including congenital blindness, nystagmus, and oculodigital sign. Caused by mutations in RPE65 gene."

      "explanation": "X-linked disorder with nystagmus, reduced visual acuity, and myopia/hypermetropia. Eye poking is less common but the other features fit."

      "explanation": "Presents with nystagmus, reduced visual acuity, and refractive errors. Eye poking is not typical but severe visual impairment in early childhood could lead to this behavior."
