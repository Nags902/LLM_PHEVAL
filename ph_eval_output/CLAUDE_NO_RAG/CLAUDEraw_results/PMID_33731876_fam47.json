      "explanation": "CNS hypomyelination is a cardinal feature. The severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, and EEG abnormalities are consistent, though infantile spasms are less typical."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy that can evolve to West syndrome with hypsarrhythmia. Features severe developmental delay and hypotonia, though hypomyelination is not typical."

      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Can present with infantile spasms, autism, and intellectual disability. Hypomyelination can occur but is not a primary feature. Brain lesions would typically be seen on imaging."

      "disease_name": "Tuberous sclerosis complex 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613254",
      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "Similar presentation to TSC1 with infantile spasms, autism, and intellectual disability. Hypomyelination is possible but secondary. Would expect additional features like skin lesions."
