      "explanation": "Rare variant of neurofibromatosis that can present with cafe-au-lait spots and neurofibromas, but typically has later onset and less severe manifestations than NF1."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Presents with multiple cafe-au-lait spots and freckling similar to NF1, but typically lacks neurofibromas. The presence of plexiform neurofibroma makes this less likely."

      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Can present with cafe-au-lait spots, but these are typically large with irregular borders. Lacks freckling and neurofibromas, and usually has endocrine abnormalities."

      "explanation": "Combines features of NF1 (cafe-au-lait spots, freckling, neurofibromas) with Noonan syndrome features. Patient data doesn't mention Noonan features but cannot be excluded."
