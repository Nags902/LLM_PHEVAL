      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Classic presentation with severe intellectual disability, absent speech, motor stereotypies, microcephaly, seizures including infantile spasms, and gait abnormalities. The combination of these features strongly suggests Rett syndrome."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Presents with severe intellectual disability, absent speech, seizures, motor stereotypies, microcephaly, and gait disturbances. However, precocious puberty is less typical."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Features early-onset seizures including infantile spasms, severe intellectual disability, absent speech, and motor stereotypies. The multiple seizure types and severe neurodevelopmental phenotype fit well."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:607208",
      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "Early-onset epileptic encephalopathy with multiple seizure types, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. However, the severity of intellectual disability and absent speech are more severe than typical."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.125,
      "explanation": "Characterized by infantile spasms, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. However, this is typically a syndrome rather than a specific genetic diagnosis, and doesn't explain all features."
