      "disease_name": "Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 1A",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607596",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "PCH1A presents with cerebellar hypoplasia, microcephaly, severe developmental delay, and progressive motor deterioration. The combination of cerebellar hypoplasia with microcephaly and severe neurodevelopmental features strongly suggests this diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 2A",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:277470",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "PCH2A features progressive microcephaly, severe developmental delay, and cerebellar/pontine hypoplasia. While it doesn't typically include hearing loss, the cerebellar and developmental features are highly consistent."

      "disease_name": "CASK-Related Disorders",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300749",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "CASK mutations cause microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia (MICPCH), intellectual disability, and can include hearing loss and strabismus. The phenotypic overlap is substantial."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:213300",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Features cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and can include strabismus. However, hearing loss is uncommon and microcephaly is not typical."

      "disease_name": "Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 6",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611523",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "PCH6 includes severe developmental delay, microcephaly, and pontocerebellar hypoplasia. Some cases have been reported with hearing impairment, making it a consideration."

      "disease_name": "Cohen Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:216550",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Features microcephaly, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and can include strabismus. However, cerebellar hypoplasia is not a core feature, and patients typically have distinctive facial features."

      "disease_name": "Cockayne Syndrome Type A",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:216400",
      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "Includes microcephaly, developmental delay, sensorineural hearing loss, and cerebellar atrophy. However, it typically presents with progressive neurodegeneration and photosensitivity."
