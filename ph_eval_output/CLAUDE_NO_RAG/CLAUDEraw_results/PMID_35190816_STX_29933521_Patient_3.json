      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "West syndrome is characterized by the triad of epileptic spasms (infantile spasms), developmental regression, and hypsarrhythmia on EEG. Epileptic spasms are the hallmark feature."

      "disease_name": "Ohtahara syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy that can present with epileptic spasms, though tonic seizures are more characteristic. Often evolves to West syndrome."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:191100",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "TSC1 commonly presents with epileptic spasms in infancy. A significant cause of symptomatic West syndrome, though other features like skin lesions typically present."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:613254",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "TSC2 mutations cause more severe phenotype than TSC1 and frequently present with infantile spasms. Additional features usually develop over time."

      "explanation": "X-linked disorder that can present with early-onset epileptic spasms, particularly in females. Associated with severe developmental impairment."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",

      "explanation": "ARX mutations can cause X-linked West syndrome with epileptic spasms. More common in males but can affect females through X-inactivation patterns."

      "disease_name": "Dravet syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607208",
      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "While primarily associated with febrile seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, some patients can develop epileptic spasms during their disease course."

      "explanation": "Can present with various seizure types including epileptic spasms. Important to consider as it's treatable with pyridoxine supplementation."
