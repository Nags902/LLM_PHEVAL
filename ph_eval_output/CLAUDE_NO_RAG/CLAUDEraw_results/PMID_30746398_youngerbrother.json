      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Early-onset parkinsonism with cerebellar atrophy, pyramidal signs (hyperreflexia, Babinski), and autonomic features. The combination of parkinsonian, cerebellar, and pyramidal signs is classic for MSA."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Can present with parkinsonism, cerebellar atrophy, and pyramidal signs. The young age of onset and combination of features fits, though parkinsonism is less prominent than in MSA."

      "explanation": "Can present with parkinsonism, pyramidal signs, and cerebellar involvement. The phenotypic variability includes parkinsonian presentations with pyramidal features."

      "explanation": "Can present with early-onset parkinsonism and neurological signs. While cerebellar atrophy is less typical, the young age and movement disorder warrant consideration."

      "explanation": "Can present with parkinsonism, pyramidal signs, and dystonia in young adults. Cerebellar involvement is less common but possible."
