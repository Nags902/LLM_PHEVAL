      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "BSCL2 presents with generalized lipodystrophy, insulin resistance/diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatic steatosis. The early onset (21 years) with severe metabolic complications including pancreatitis strongly suggests this form."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:608594",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "BSCL1 caused by AGPAT2 mutations presents similarly with generalized lipodystrophy and metabolic complications, though typically with less severe diabetes and pancreatitis compared to BSCL2."

      "disease_name": "Familial partial lipodystrophy, Dunnigan type",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151660",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "FPLD2 shows loss of subcutaneous fat in limbs and trunk with preserved facial fat, along with insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. However, onset is typically post-pubertal and less severe than congenital forms."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:608600",
