      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Perfect match with peripheral nerve amyloidosis and gastrointestinal symptoms (alternating diarrhea/constipation). Age of presentation (62 years) fits late-onset variant. Most common form of hereditary systemic amyloidosis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:105200",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Can cause peripheral neuropathy and GI symptoms, though less commonly affects peripheral nerves compared to transthyretin amyloidosis. Typically presents in middle to late adulthood."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Systemic amyloidosis that can involve peripheral nerves and cause GI symptoms, but peripheral neuropathy is less prominent than in TTR amyloidosis. Age fits the typical presentation."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:153450",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Rare hereditary amyloidosis that can affect multiple organs including nerves and GI tract. Peripheral neuropathy is not the most prominent feature but can occur."

      "explanation": "Though not strictly hereditary, AL amyloidosis commonly presents in this age group with peripheral neuropathy and GI symptoms. Most common form of systemic amyloidosis overall."
