      "explanation": "Matches hydrocephalus, midface retrusion, and developmental delays. The villous hypertrophy of choroid plexus is particularly suggestive of achondroplasia-related complications."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:108300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "High myopia and visual impairment are cardinal features. Midface retrusion is common. Developmental delays can occur secondary to sensory impairments."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:607014",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Explains intellectual disability, developmental delay, hydrocephalus, and facial dysmorphisms including midface retrusion and protruding tongue."

      "disease_name": "Down Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:190685",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Features protruding tongue, upslanted palpebral fissures, intellectual disability, and developmental delays. However, lacks some typical features and hydrocephalus is less common."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:236670",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Severe congenital muscular dystrophy with hydrocephalus, visual impairment, and intellectual disability. The choroid plexus abnormality supports brain malformation."

      "explanation": "Hydrocephalus is the primary feature with intellectual disability and developmental delays. Less likely given multiple dysmorphic features present."
