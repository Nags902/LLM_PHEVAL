      "disease_id": "OMIM:220210",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Strong match with characteristic triad of craniofacial anomalies (hypertelorism, cleft palate, pointed chin), cerebellar abnormalities (Dandy-Walker malformation, hypoplasia of brainstem), and cardiac defects. Also matches hypotonia, developmental delays, and distinctive facial features."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:235730",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Matches many features including distinctive facial features (hypertelorism, pointed chin, wide mouth, cupid's bow), Dandy-Walker malformation, developmental delay, seizures, and feeding difficulties. However, lacks some characteristic features like Hirschsprung disease."

      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Consistent with cleft palate, characteristic facial features, developmental delays, hearing impairment, recurrent infections, and feeding difficulties. However, Dandy-Walker malformation is less typical."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Some overlapping features including cleft palate, ptosis, developmental delays, hypotonia, and feeding difficulties. However, lacks characteristic 2-3 toe syndactyly and Dandy-Walker malformation is uncommon."
