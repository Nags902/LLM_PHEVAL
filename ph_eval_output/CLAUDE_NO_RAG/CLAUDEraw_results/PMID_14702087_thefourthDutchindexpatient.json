      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Presents with all four features: photophobia, reduced visual acuity, and difficulties with light adaptation including bradyopsia. Primary cone dysfunction explains the complete phenotype."

      "disease_name": "Cone-Rod Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:120970",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Shows photophobia, reduced visual acuity, and light adaptation problems. The cone involvement explains bradyopsia, though rod involvement may cause additional features not mentioned."

      "disease_name": "Achromatopsia 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:216900",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Complete color blindness with severe photophobia, reduced visual acuity, and adaptation difficulties. Bradyopsia can occur due to reliance on rod vision."

      "disease_name": "Achromatopsia 3",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:262300",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Similar to Achromatopsia 2, caused by mutations in different genes but presenting with comparable features including photophobia and adaptation difficulties."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:204000",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with photophobia and severely reduced visual acuity. Light adaptation problems including bradyopsia may occur, though typically more severe vision loss."

      "disease_name": "Retinitis Pigmentosa",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:268000",
      "score": 0.167,
      "explanation": "Can show photophobia and reduced visual acuity. Bradyopsia may occur due to rod dysfunction, though night blindness is more typical than the described phenotype."

    {
      "disease_name": "Oguchi Disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:258100",
      "score": 0.143,
      "explanation": "Specifically features very prolonged dark adaptation (extreme bradyopsia). However, photophobia is less common and visual acuity is often normal."
