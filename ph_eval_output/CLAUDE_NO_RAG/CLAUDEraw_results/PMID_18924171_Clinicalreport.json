      "disease_name": "Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1-Alpha Deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312170",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Early neonatal presentation with seizures, hypotonia, respiratory failure, brainstem abnormalities, and corpus callosum abnormalities are classic for severe PDH deficiency. The cardiac involvement and metabolic crisis fit the clinical picture."

      "disease_name": "Mitochondrial Complex I Deficiency, Nuclear Type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:252010",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Neonatal onset with hypotonia, respiratory failure, cardiomyopathy, and brainstem involvement strongly suggests mitochondrial disease. Complex I deficiency commonly presents with this severe multisystem involvement."

      "disease_name": "Leigh Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:256000",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Classic features include brainstem abnormalities, hypotonia, respiratory failure, and seizures in infancy. The periventricular white matter changes and cardiac involvement support this diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Pompe Disease, Infantile",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:232300",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Presents with severe hypotonia, muscle weakness, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and respiratory failure in early infancy. However, CNS involvement is less typical."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:253300",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Severe neonatal hypotonia, areflexia, muscle weakness, and respiratory failure are characteristic. However, the cardiac and CNS abnormalities are atypical."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome Type 10",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:254300",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Can present with neonatal hypotonia, respiratory failure, vocal cord paralysis, and bradycardia. The CNS findings are less typical but some forms can have central involvement."

    {
      "disease_name": "Barth Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:302060",
      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "X-linked disorder presenting with cardiomyopathy, muscle weakness, and hypotonia in males. The extensive CNS involvement is less typical but can occur."

      "disease_name": "Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency Type A",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:252150",
      "score": 0.125,
      "explanation": "Presents in neonatal period with seizures, hypotonia, and brain abnormalities. The cardiac and respiratory features are less typical but can occur in severe cases."
