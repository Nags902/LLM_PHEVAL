      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Presents with reduced visual acuity and abnormal ERG, though typically shows more severe cone dysfunction. RPE changes are common but may be less prominent than in Stargardt."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Shows RPE mottling patterns and can affect visual acuity, though typically presents later in life and ERG changes are usually mild."

      "explanation": "Shows severely abnormal ERG and vision loss, but typically presents in infancy with severe visual impairment, making it less likely given the patient's age."
