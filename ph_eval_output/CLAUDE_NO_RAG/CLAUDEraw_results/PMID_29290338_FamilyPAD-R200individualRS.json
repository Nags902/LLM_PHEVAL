      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Classic presentation with all major diagnostic criteria: multiple cafe-au-lait spots, axillary/inguinal freckling, neurofibromas, and Lisch nodules. Patient meets NIH diagnostic criteria for NF1."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:101000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Less likely as NF2 typically presents with bilateral vestibular schwannomas rather than cutaneous neurofibromas. Cafe-au-lait spots and freckling are less common in NF2."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Shares cafe-au-lait spots and freckling with NF1, but lacks neurofibromas and Lisch nodules, making it unlikely given this patient's full phenotype."
