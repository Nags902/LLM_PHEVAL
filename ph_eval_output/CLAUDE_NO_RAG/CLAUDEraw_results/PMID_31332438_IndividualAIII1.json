      "disease_id": "OMIM:609260",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "CMT2A presents with motor axonal neuropathy, lower limb muscle weakness and amyotrophy, unsteady gait, and frequent falls. The age of onset in the 20s fits with adult-onset forms of CMT2A."

      "disease_name": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:600882",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "CMT2B is characterized by axonal motor neuropathy with prominent sensory involvement including impaired vibratory sensation. Lower limb weakness and muscle atrophy are typical features."

      "disease_name": "Distal hereditary motor neuropathy type II",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:608634",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "dHMN II presents with distal motor axonal neuropathy, lower limb muscle weakness and atrophy, and gait difficulties. However, sensory involvement is less typical."

      "disease_name": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601472",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "CMT2D features motor axonal neuropathy with distal muscle weakness and atrophy. The presentation often begins in upper limbs, making it less likely given the lower limb predominance."

      "disease_name": "Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:162400",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "HSAN I can present with sensory loss including vibratory sensation and secondary motor involvement. However, primary motor axonal neuropathy is less typical."

      "disease_name": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:109150",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "SCA3 can present with peripheral neuropathy, gait ataxia, and muscle atrophy. Age of onset fits, but cerebellar signs are typically more prominent than described."
