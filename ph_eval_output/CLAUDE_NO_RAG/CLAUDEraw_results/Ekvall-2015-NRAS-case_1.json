      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Strong match with multiple cardinal features including short neck, low posterior hairline, growth delay, cardiomyopathy, ptosis, hypertelorism, downslanted palpebral fissures, broad forehead, low-set ears, and feeding difficulties. PTPN11 mutation-associated."

      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (LEOPARD Syndrome)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Excellent match with freckling/lentigines, cardiomyopathy, hypertelorism, growth delay, and typical facial features. The presence of cafe-au-lait spots and freckling strongly suggests this subtype."

      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:605275",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Similar phenotype to NS1 but caused by PTPN11 mutations at different sites. Presents with same core features including cardiac involvement and typical facial dysmorphism."

      "disease_name": "Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:115150",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "RASopathy with overlapping features including cardiomyopathy, growth delay, hypertelorism, downslanted palpebral fissures, and macrocephaly. BRAF mutation-associated."

      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis-Noonan Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601321",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Combines features of both NF1 and Noonan syndrome. The presence of cafe-au-lait spots, freckling, and typical Noonan features suggests this overlap syndrome."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:609942",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "KRAS mutation-associated Noonan syndrome with similar phenotype but may have more severe intellectual disability and cardiac features."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:218040",
