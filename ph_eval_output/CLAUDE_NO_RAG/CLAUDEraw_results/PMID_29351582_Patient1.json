      "disease_id": "OMIM:214400",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "CMT4A presents with early-onset progressive motor axonal neuropathy, distal muscle weakness and atrophy, pes cavus, steppage gait, and loss of ambulation. The facial involvement with ptosis and weakness fits the severe phenotype."

      "disease_name": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:118210",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "CMT2A1 is an axonal neuropathy with early onset, progressive distal weakness, pes cavus, and gait abnormalities. However, facial involvement is less common than in CMT4A."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "CMS5 presents with ptosis, facial weakness, and progressive motor difficulties. The fasciculations and neuropathic features make this less likely than primary neuropathies."

      "explanation": "SMA-PME shows facial-lingual fasciculations, progressive weakness, and loss of ambulation. The presence of peripheral neuropathy features makes this less typical."

      "explanation": "BVVL1 presents with bulbar palsy, facial weakness, ptosis, and progressive motor neuropathy. The age of onset and peripheral neuropathy features are consistent."

      "explanation": "IOSCA can present with peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, and progressive motor deterioration. However, the prominent facial features and fasciculations are less typical."
