      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Bull's eye maculopathy is a characteristic finding, along with reduced visual acuity. Peripheral retinal atrophy can occur in advanced cases. Nystagmus is less common but possible."

      "explanation": "Autosomal dominant form presenting with bull's eye maculopathy and progressive visual loss. Peripheral involvement and nystagmus can occur but are less typical than in CRD3."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Bull's eye maculopathy and reduced visual acuity are core features. Peripheral retinal involvement is less common in pure cone dystrophies. Nystagmus can occur with severe photophobia."

      "explanation": "Presents with bull's eye-like macular changes and mild visual reduction. Peripheral retinal atrophy and nystagmus are not typical features, making this less likely."

      "explanation": "Severe early-onset retinal dystrophy with nystagmus and poor vision. Bull's eye maculopathy is not typical, but various macular changes can occur. Peripheral atrophy is common."
