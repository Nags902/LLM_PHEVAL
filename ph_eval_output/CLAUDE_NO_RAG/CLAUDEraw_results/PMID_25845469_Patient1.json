      "disease_name": "Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 2A",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:277470",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Strong match with hypoplasia of the pons, profound intellectual disability, dystonia, spasticity, absent speech, and feeding difficulties. The nonprogressive encephalopathy and EEG abnormalities are also consistent."

      "disease_name": "Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 2B",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:612389",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similar to PCH2A with pontine hypoplasia, severe developmental delay, dystonia, and spasticity. The clinical presentation closely matches the patient's phenotype."
    },

      "disease_name": "Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 2D",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613811",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Another PCH2 variant presenting with pontine hypoplasia, profound intellectual disability, dystonia, and feeding difficulties. The movement disorder features align well."

      "disease_name": "Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 10",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:615803",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Features pontine hypoplasia with severe developmental delay, spasticity, and feeding difficulties. The overall neurological picture fits the patient's presentation."

      "disease_name": "FOXG1 Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613454",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Characterized by profound intellectual disability, absent speech, dystonia, EEG abnormalities, and feeding difficulties. While pontine hypoplasia is less common, the overall phenotype shows significant overlap."

      "disease_name": "Angelman Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:105830",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Features absent speech, profound intellectual disability, EEG abnormalities, feeding difficulties in infancy, and hypotonia. Dystonia can occur but pontine hypoplasia is not typical."

    {
      "disease_name": "Rett Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312750",
      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "Presents with profound intellectual disability, dystonia, spasticity, feeding difficulties, and absent speech. However, typically affects females and pontine hypoplasia is not characteristic."

      "disease_name": "Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:610954",
      "score": 0.125,
      "explanation": "Shows profound intellectual disability, absent speech, dystonia, and EEG abnormalities. The movement disorder and developmental features align, though pontine hypoplasia is not typical."
