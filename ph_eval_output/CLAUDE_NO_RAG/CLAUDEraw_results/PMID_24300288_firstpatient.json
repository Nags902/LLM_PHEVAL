      "disease_id": "OMIM:253000",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Strong match with platyspondyly, beaking of vertebral bodies, genu valgum, waddling gait, coarse facial features, short neck, and skeletal dysplasia features. The combination of spinal and hip abnormalities is characteristic."

      "disease_name": "Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB (Morquio syndrome B)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:253010",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similar skeletal manifestations to MPS IVA but typically milder. Matches platyspondyly, vertebral changes, and coarse features, though usually has less severe skeletal involvement."

      "disease_name": "Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:183900",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Matches platyspondyly, short neck, rhizomelia, flat acetabular roof, and waddling gait. However, coarse facial features and intellectual disability are less typical."

      "disease_name": "Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:253200",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Presents with coarse facial features, skeletal dysplasia, and vertebral abnormalities. However, intellectual disability is not typical in MPS VI, making it less likely."

      "disease_name": "Pseudoachondroplasia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:177170",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Matches rhizomelia, waddling gait, genu valgum, and vertebral abnormalities. However, lacks typical features like normal facies at birth and absence of intellectual disability."

      "disease_name": "Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:223800",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Features platyspondyly with vertebral changes, intellectual disability, and short stature. The skeletal pattern partially matches but lacks some characteristic features like lacy iliac crests."

      "disease_name": "Smith-McCort dysplasia 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607326",
      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "Similar to Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen disease but typically without intellectual disability. The presence of intellectual disability in this patient makes it less likely, though skeletal features partially match."

      "disease_name": "Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia type 4",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:226900",

      "explanation": "Can present with short metacarpals/metatarsals and hip abnormalities. However, lacks the severe spinal involvement and coarse features seen in this patient."
