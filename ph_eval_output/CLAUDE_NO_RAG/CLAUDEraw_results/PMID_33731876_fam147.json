      "disease_name": "Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:600513",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "ADNFLE is characterized by focal seizures arising from the frontal lobe, typically occurring during sleep. The focal-onset seizure phenotype directly matches this condition."

      "disease_name": "Familial Focal Epilepsy with Variable Foci 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:604364",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "FFEVF presents with focal seizures that can originate from different brain regions. The focal-onset seizure phenotype is a key feature of this condition."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Autosomal Dominant Partial Epilepsy with Auditory Features",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:600512",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "ADPEAF typically presents with focal seizures originating from the lateral temporal lobe, often with auditory auras. Focal-onset seizures are characteristic."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Familial Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy with Hippocampal Sclerosis",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:616436",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "FMTLE presents with focal seizures originating from the mesial temporal structures. The focal-onset seizure phenotype fits this diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Dravet Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607208",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "While Dravet syndrome typically presents with generalized seizures, focal seizures can also occur, especially in early stages. SCN1A mutations cause this severe epilepsy syndrome."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Focal Cortical Dysplasia Type II",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607341",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "FCD Type II is a malformation of cortical development that commonly causes focal-onset seizures. This is a structural cause of focal epilepsy."

    {
      "disease_name": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:191100",
      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "TSC1 can present with focal seizures due to cortical tubers. While other features are typically present, isolated focal seizures can be an early manifestation."

      "disease_name": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613254",
      "score": 0.125,
      "explanation": "Similar to TSC1, TSC2 can cause focal seizures due to cortical tubers. The focal-onset seizure may be an initial presenting feature."
