      "disease_id": "OMIM:181350",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Classic presentation with Achilles tendon contractures, spinal rigidity, stiff neck, scapuloperoneal distribution of muscle weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias. The age and combination of contractures with cardiac involvement strongly suggest EDMD2."

      "disease_name": "Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy 1, X-linked",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:310300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Presents with similar features to EDMD2 including contractures, rigid spine, and cardiac arrhythmias. However, X-linked inheritance is less likely in a female patient, though carrier manifestations are possible."

      "disease_name": "Rigid Spine Muscular Dystrophy 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:602771",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Characterized by spinal rigidity and progressive muscle weakness, which matches several features. However, the prominent cardiac involvement and Achilles contractures are less typical."

      "disease_name": "Bethlem Myopathy 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:158810",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Features contractures and muscle weakness, but typically has a milder phenotype. The cardiac arrhythmias and severe spinal rigidity are less common in Bethlem myopathy."

      "disease_name": "Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy, Type 1B",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:159001",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness, but the prominent contractures and spinal rigidity pattern are less typical for LGMD1B."

      "disease_name": "Myofibrillar Myopathy 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601419",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Can cause muscle weakness and cardiac involvement, but the specific pattern of contractures and scapuloperoneal distribution is less characteristic of MFM1."
