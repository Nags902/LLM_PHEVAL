      "explanation": "The patient presents with pathognomonic features including glutaric aciduria, elevated 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, macrocephaly, dystonia, enlarged sylvian cisterns, and acute encephalopathy. These findings are classic for GA-I, caused by glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:231680",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Also presents with glutaric aciduria and encephalopathy, but typically has multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency with broader metabolic derangements. The specific elevation of 3-hydroxyglutaric acid and enlarged sylvian cisterns are more characteristic of Type I."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:231530",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Presents with elevated 3-hydroxyglutaric acid and neurological symptoms including seizures and developmental delay. However, the combination with glutaric aciduria and specific neuroimaging findings makes GA-I more likely."

      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Can present with acute encephalopathy, seizures, and dystonia. However, the specific organic aciduria pattern and enlarged sylvian cisterns are not typical features of MELAS."

      "explanation": "A mitochondrial disorder that can present with dystonia, seizures, and developmental regression. However, the specific pattern of organic aciduria and macrocephaly with enlarged sylvian cisterns are not characteristic features."
