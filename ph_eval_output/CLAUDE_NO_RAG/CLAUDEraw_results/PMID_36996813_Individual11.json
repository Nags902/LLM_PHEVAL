      "disease_name": "COL4A1-related brain small-vessel disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:175780",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "COL4A1 mutations cause small vessel disease with characteristic features including cerebral hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, dilated ventricles, and cerebral calcifications. The combination of hemorrhage and calcification is particularly suggestive of this diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "COL4A2-related brain small-vessel disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:614519",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similar to COL4A1, COL4A2 mutations cause small vessel disease with intracerebral hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and ventricular dilatation. Calcifications can also occur, though less commonly than in COL4A1-related disease."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:225750",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "AGS1 can present with cerebral calcifications, ventriculomegaly, and sometimes hemorrhage. The intracranial calcifications are a hallmark feature, though hemorrhage is less common than in COL4A1/A2 disorders."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:610181",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "AGS2 due to RNASEH2B mutations presents similarly to AGS1 with cerebral calcifications and ventriculomegaly. Hydrocephalus can occur, though hemorrhage is uncommon."

    {
      "disease_name": "Sturge-Weber syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:185300",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with cerebral calcifications, ventricular enlargement, and occasionally intracerebral hemorrhage. The leptomeningeal angiomatosis can lead to these complications."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Cerebral cavernous malformations 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:116860",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "CCM1 can cause recurrent cerebral hemorrhages and may lead to hydrocephalus. Calcifications can occur in chronic lesions, though this is not a primary feature."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Band-like calcification with simplified gyration and polymicrogyria",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:251290",
      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "This rare disorder features prominent cerebral calcifications and can have associated hydrocephalus and ventricular dilatation. Hemorrhage is not typical but the calcification pattern is distinctive."

    {
      "disease_name": "Cockayne syndrome B",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:133540",
      "score": 0.125,
      "explanation": "Can present with cerebral calcifications and ventricular dilatation. Hydrocephalus is less common, and hemorrhage is rare, but the calcifications are a consistent feature."
