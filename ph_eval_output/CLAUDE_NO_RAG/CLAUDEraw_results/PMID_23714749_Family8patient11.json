      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Perfect match with key features: mitochondrial DNA depletion in liver, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and liver dysfunction (jaundice). The hepatocerebral form typically presents in infancy."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Features mitochondrial DNA depletion and can present with hypotonia and feeding difficulties, though typically has later onset. Liver involvement with jaundice is possible."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Shows mitochondrial DNA depletion and hypotonia, but primarily affects muscle rather than liver. Feeding difficulties common but jaundice is not typical."

      "explanation": "Can present in infancy with jaundice and coagulation abnormalities due to liver dysfunction. Feeding difficulties may occur secondarily, but mitochondrial DNA depletion is not a feature."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:257220",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with neonatal jaundice, hypotonia, and feeding difficulties. Liver dysfunction can cause coagulation issues, but mitochondrial DNA depletion is not characteristic."

      "explanation": "Presents with severe jaundice and coagulation abnormalities in infancy. Feeding difficulties are common, but hypotonia and mitochondrial DNA depletion are not typical features."
