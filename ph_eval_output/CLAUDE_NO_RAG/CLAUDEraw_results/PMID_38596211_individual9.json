      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Classic presentation with axillary and inguinal freckling (pathognomonic signs) plus cafe-au-lait spots. These features together are highly specific for NF1."

      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Presents with cafe-au-lait spots and freckling similar to NF1 but typically milder phenotype. Caused by SPRED1 mutations."
    },

      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:101000",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Less likely as cutaneous features are less prominent in NF2, which typically presents with schwannomas rather than freckling."

      "disease_name": "McCune-Albright syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Can have cafe-au-lait spots but typically larger and irregular with jagged borders. Freckling is not a typical feature."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Previously called LEOPARD syndrome. Has multiple lentigines but these typically appear later and have different distribution than axillary/inguinal freckling."

      "disease_name": "Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:276300",
      "score": 0.167,
      "explanation": "Can present with cafe-au-lait spots resembling NF1, but freckling is less common and other features like early-onset cancers would be expected."
