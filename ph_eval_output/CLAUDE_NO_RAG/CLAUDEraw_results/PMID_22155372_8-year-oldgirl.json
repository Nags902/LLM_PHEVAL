      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "SQTS1 is characterized by shortened QT interval and increased risk of atrial fibrillation, matching both key features. Caused by gain-of-function mutations in KCNH2."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:609621",

      "explanation": "SQTS2 also presents with shortened QT interval and arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation. Caused by mutations in KCNQ1."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:609622",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "SQTS3 features shortened QT interval and various arrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation is less commonly reported but possible. Caused by KCNJ2 mutations."

      "explanation": "FHH can cause hypercalcemia leading to shortened QT interval. Arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation can occur secondary to electrolyte imbalance."

      "explanation": "Similar to FHH1, can cause hypercalcemia with shortened QT interval and potential arrhythmias. Caused by GNA11 mutations."

      "explanation": "Can cause severe hypercalcemia leading to shortened QT interval. Cardiac arrhythmias are possible complications, though typically presents earlier than 8 years."
