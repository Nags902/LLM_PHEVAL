      "disease_name": "Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like Episodes (MELAS)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:540000",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's increased CSF lactate, respiratory failure, motor regression, brisk reflexes, hypotonia, and MRI findings closely resemble the metabolic disturbances seen in MELAS, which is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and symptoms including lactic acidosis and neurological deficits."

      "disease_name": "Encephalopathy, neonatal severe, with lactic acidosis and brain abnormalities",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:614461",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The combination of increased CSF lactate, respiratory difficulties, and developmental delays in this infant suggests a severe neonatal encephalopathy, similar to the presented reference case, which shares features including motor regression and hypotonia."

    {
      "disease_name": "Multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome 7",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:615155",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "This condition is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction leading to neurological symptoms, which align with the patient's abnormalities in MRI morphology, respiratory failure, and metabolic anomalies."

    {
      "disease_name": "Non-ketotic Hyperglycinemia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:605899",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "The increase in CSF lactate and the presence of severe hypotonia and nystagmus could indicate metabolic issues similar to those observed in non-ketotic hyperglycinemia, which often presents with similar neurological deficits and abnormal MRI findings."
