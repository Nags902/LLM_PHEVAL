      "disease_name": "Multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome 7",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:616157",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The combination of increased CSF lactate, respiratory failure, severe muscular hypotonia, abnormal cerebral MRI findings, motor regression, and feeding difficulties aligns closely with the characteristics of Multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome 7. This disease involves mitochondrial impairments that manifest in severe neurological symptoms observed in this patient."

      "disease_name": "Encephalopathy, neonatal severe, with lactic acidosis and brain abnormalities",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:614465",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Features such as increased CSF lactate, motor regression, abnormal cerebral cortex morphology, respiratory failure, feeding difficulties, and severe hypotonia are consistent with Encephalopathy, neonatal severe, with lactic acidosis and brain abnormalities, pointing towards a significant metabolic issue affecting the brain."

    {
      "disease_name": "Leigh syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:256000",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The pattern of increased CSF lactate, abnormal MRI findings, motor regression, and severe hypotonia also suggests Leigh syndrome, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by defects in mitochondrial energy production, although there are some discrepancies in specific phenotypic manifestations."
