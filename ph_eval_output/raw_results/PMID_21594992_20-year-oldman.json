      "disease_id": "OMIM:616914",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features largely overlap with previously diagnosed cases of Marfan lipodystrophy syndrome, including high palate, high myopia, ectopia lentis, generalized lipodystrophy, arachnodactyly, hyperextensibility of finger joints, pectus excavatum, relative macrocephaly, and progeroid facial appearance. This condition is known to exhibit a combination of skeletal abnormalities, ocular symptoms, and lipodystrophy, which matches the presented phenotype closely."

      "disease_name": "Congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:608594",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Although not a perfect match, the presence of generalized lipodystrophy, reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue, and progeroid facial appearance makes congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 1 a possible diagnosis. Features like ectopia lentis and high myopia are less typical for this condition but lipodystrophy is a key feature."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:608328",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "The presence of high myopia, ectopia lentis, and skeletal abnormalities such as arachnodactyly could suggest Weill-Marchesani syndrome. However, the distinct lipodystrophy features in the patient make this diagnosis less likely compared to other options."
