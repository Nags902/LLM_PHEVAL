      "disease_name": "Autosomal Dominant Osteopetrosis Type 2 (Albers-Schonberg Disease)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:166600",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This disease is characterized by increased bone density due to defective osteoclast function. It aligns strongly with the core features of cortical thickening of long bone diaphyses, narrowing of the medullary canal, humeral cortical thickening, hyperostosis, bone pain, and waddling gait. Proptosis, ptosis, and prominent forehead can occur due to cranial nerve compression and skull thickening. While hypocalcemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase are more common in severe infantile forms of osteopetrosis, they can manifest in milder or more complex presentations of ADO2, or in intermediate autosomal recessive forms (e.g., OMIM:259730), due to impaired calcium release from bone and ongoing osteoblastic activity."

      "disease_name": "Sclerosteosis",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:269500",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Sclerosteosis is a severe generalized hyperostotic bone disorder. It is an excellent match for most skeletal features including cortical thickening, narrowing of the medullary canal, severe hyperostosis, bone pain, and waddling gait. Craniofacial features like prominent forehead, proptosis, and ptosis are also highly characteristic due to massive skull overgrowth and cranial nerve impingement. However, hypocalcemia and consistently elevated alkaline phosphatase are not typical features, which is the primary reason it is ranked below osteopetrosis for this specific patient profile."

      "disease_name": "Van Buchem Disease (Hyperostosis Corticalis Generalisata)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:239100",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Van Buchem disease is an autosomal recessive disorder similar to sclerosteosis, characterized by generalized hyperostosis, cortical thickening, and narrowing of the medullary canal, particularly affecting the skull and long bones. It aligns well with the prominent forehead, proptosis, ptosis, bone pain, and waddling gait. Like sclerosteosis, the absence of typical hypocalcemia and consistently elevated alkaline phosphatase makes it a less perfect fit compared to osteopetrosis, but it remains a strong candidate for the extensive hyperostosis."

      "disease_name": "Camurati-Engelmann Disease (Progressive Diaphyseal Dysplasia)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:131300",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by progressive cortical thickening and hyperostosis of the diaphyses of long bones, which matches features like cortical thickening, humeral cortical thickening, hyperostosis, bone pain, and waddling gait. Cranial nerve compression leading to proptosis or ptosis can also occur. However, narrowing of the medullary canal is less consistently severe, and a prominent forehead is not a typical feature. Crucially, calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels are usually normal, which is a key discrepancy for this patient."

      "disease_name": "Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia, Autosomal Dominant",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:123000",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Craniometaphyseal dysplasia is characterized by widening of the metaphyses of long bones and progressive thickening of the skull. It explains features like prominent forehead, proptosis, ptosis, and hyperostosis. While some cortical thickening can be present, the emphasis on diaphyseal cortical thickening and significant narrowing of the medullary canal is less prominent compared to other conditions on this list. Furthermore, hypocalcemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase are not characteristic features of CMD."
