      "explanation": "The cortical thickening of the long bones, bone pain, and waddling gait resemble symptoms of this bone dysplasia."

      "explanation": "Characterized by generalized skeletal sclerosis, including cortical thickening and narrowing of the medullary canal."

      "explanation": "While not typically associated with hypocalcemia, the bone pain, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and hyperostosis can point towards Paget disease."
