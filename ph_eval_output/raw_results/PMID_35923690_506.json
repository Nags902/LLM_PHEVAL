      "disease_id": "OMIM:105650",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The presentation of anemia, colon cancer, increased mean corpuscular volume, elevated red cell adenosine deaminase activity, and a small thenar eminence strongly points to Diamond-Blackfan Anemia 1, as seen in similar reference cases."

      "disease_name": "Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:227646",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Features overlap with Fanconi anemia include anemia and increased cancer risk, although elevated red cell adenosine deaminase is not typical, but some overlapping features warrant consideration."

      "disease_name": "Myelodysplastic Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:614286",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "Myelodysplastic syndromes can present with anemia and increased mean corpuscular volume, but the presence of elevated red cell adenosine deaminase activity makes this a less likely candidate."
