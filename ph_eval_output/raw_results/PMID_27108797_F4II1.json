      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Gillespie syndrome is characterized by aniridia, cerebellar ataxia, and intellectual disability, which aligns with the patient's features of aniridia, ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, and delayed motor milestones."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "WAGR syndrome includes aniridia and developmental delay, but typically does not include cerebellar atrophy or ataxia, making it less likely but still possible given the aniridia and hypotonia."

      "explanation": "Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome features cerebellar ataxia, hypotonia, and nystagmus, but aniridia is not a typical feature, which reduces its likelihood."
