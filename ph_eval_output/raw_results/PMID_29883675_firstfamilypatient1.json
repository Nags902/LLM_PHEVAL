      "disease_id": "OMIM:614261",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This syndrome presents with microcephaly, polymicrogyria, intellectual disability, and short stature - matching most of the patient's key features. The brain malformations including polymicrogyria are characteristic."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:614833",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition specifically includes the triad of microcephaly, short stature, and polymicrogyria seen in this patient, along with intellectual disability. The phenotypic match is very strong."

      "disease_name": "Microcephaly 5, primary, autosomal recessive",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:608716",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Primary microcephaly type 5 can present with microcephaly, intellectual disability, and absent speech. While it doesn't typically include polymicrogyria, the severity of brain abnormalities can vary."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:617090",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This form of primary microcephaly can present with severe intellectual disability, absent speech, and corpus callosum abnormalities. Short stature may also occur."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:615574",

      "disease_id": "OMIM:216550",
      "score": 0.167,
      "explanation": "Cohen syndrome includes microcephaly, intellectual disability, and short stature. While polymicrogyria is not typical, the overall phenotypic overlap is significant."
