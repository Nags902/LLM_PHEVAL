      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "All three reference cases with nearly identical phenotypes were diagnosed with this condition. The patient shares key features including coarse facial features, 11 pairs of ribs, long philtrum, tented upper lip vermilion, epicanthus, hirsutism, absent speech, motor delay, global developmental delay, and hypotonia."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Presents with coarse facial features, hirsutism, developmental delay, hypotonia, and absent/delayed speech. The 11 pairs of ribs could represent a skeletal anomaly consistent with this syndrome."

      "explanation": "Classic features include coarse facial features, developmental delay, and skeletal abnormalities. The 11 pairs of ribs could represent dysostosis multiplex. Hirsutism is also commonly seen."

      "explanation": "Presents with hirsutism, long philtrum, developmental delays, and distinctive facial features. The skeletal anomaly (11 ribs) fits with limb/skeletal abnormalities seen in this syndrome."
