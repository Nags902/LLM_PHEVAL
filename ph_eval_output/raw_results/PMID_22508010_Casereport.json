      "disease_id": "OMIM:256810",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptomatology, including the impaired tactile and vibratory sensation, peripheral axonal neuropathy, hepatic steatosis, hepatomegaly, and mitochondrial DNA deletions closely aligns with the phenotypic features and similar cases of Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 6 (hepatocerebral type)."

      "disease_name": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2 (CMT2)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:118210",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The peripheral axonal neuropathy, distal muscle weakness, and impaired distal sensations are indicative of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2, especially given the presentation of distal amyotrophy and foot deformities. However, some hepatic features are not typical for CMT2, hence it is not the most likely diagnosis."

    {
      "disease_name": "Niemann-Pick disease, type C1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:257220",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "While Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 is primarily neurodegenerative with hepatosplenomegaly, the presence of hepatic steatosis and some neurological involvement makes it a consideration, albeit less likely due to the detailed mitochondrial involvement observed in the case."
