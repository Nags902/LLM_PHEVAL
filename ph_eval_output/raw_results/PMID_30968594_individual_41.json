      "disease_id": "OMIM:201910",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's decreased testosterone, increased ACTH, and increased prolactin levels correspond closely with the classic symptomatology of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is supported by similar reference cases."

      "disease_name": "Adrenal insufficiency, primary (Addison disease)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:125100",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition can present with low testosterone and high ACTH due to adrenal gland underperformance, though it typically does not cause increased prolactin levels, making it less likely but still a consideration."

    {
      "disease_name": "Hyperprolactinemia, idiopathic",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601578",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "The increased prolactin levels could suggest hyperprolactinemia; however, it does not fully explain the low testosterone and elevated ACTH, ranking it lower in likelihood."
