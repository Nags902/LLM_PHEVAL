      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Patient presents with multiple cafe-au-lait spots and freckling, which are cardinal features of NF1. All three reference cases with similar phenotypes were diagnosed with NF1. Pulmonic stenosis is a known cardiac manifestation of NF1, occurring in approximately 2% of patients."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Previously known as LEOPARD syndrome, this condition presents with multiple lentigines (which can resemble cafe-au-lait spots), and importantly, pulmonic stenosis is a major feature. However, the freckling pattern and multiple cafe-au-lait spots are more consistent with NF1."

    {
      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Pulmonic stenosis is a common cardiac finding in Noonan syndrome. While cafe-au-lait spots can occur, they are not typical, and the combination with freckling makes NF1 more likely."

      "disease_name": "Watson syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:193520",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "A rare allelic variant of NF1 that presents with cafe-au-lait spots, pulmonic stenosis, and intellectual disability. The presence of pulmonic stenosis with NF1-like features makes this a consideration."

    {
      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Presents with multiple cafe-au-lait spots and freckling similar to NF1, but typically without neurofibromas. However, cardiac manifestations like pulmonic stenosis are not typical, making this less likely."
