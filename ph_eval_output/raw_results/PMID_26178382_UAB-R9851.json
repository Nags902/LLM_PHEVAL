      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines can present with cafe-au-lait spots and pulmonic stenosis, but freckling is less commonly associated. The presence of pulmonic stenosis makes this a possible but less likely diagnosis compared to Neurofibromatosis type 1."
