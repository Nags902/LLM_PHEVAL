      "disease_id": "OMIM:610253",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Strong match with reference case 2 showing identical features: tube feeding, intellectual disability, global developmental delay, chronic constipation, talipes equinovarus, hypermetropia, depression, anxiety, developmental regression, and microcephaly. This syndrome is caused by EHMT1 gene mutations."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:617768",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similar phenotype to Kleefstra syndrome 1 but caused by KMT2C mutations. Presents with intellectual disability, developmental delay, microcephaly, and behavioral issues including anxiety and depression."

      "disease_name": "Rett syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312750",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Features developmental regression, microcephaly, intellectual disability, and constipation which are classic for Rett syndrome. However, patient's male gender makes this less likely unless atypical presentation."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:610954",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Presents with intellectual disability, developmental delay, constipation, and microcephaly. Caused by TCF4 mutations. Lacks typical breathing abnormalities but phenotype can be variable."
