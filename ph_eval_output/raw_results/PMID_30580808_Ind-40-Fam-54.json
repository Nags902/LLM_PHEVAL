      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features such as thick eyebrows, long eyelashes, downslanted palpebral fissures, wide nose, and intellectual disability are commonly seen in Noonan Syndrome. The presence of joint hypermobility and brachydactyly also aligns with this diagnosis."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient's thick eyebrows, long eyelashes, short philtrum, and intellectual disability are characteristic of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome. However, the absence of severe growth retardation and limb reductions makes this less likely than Noonan Syndrome."
