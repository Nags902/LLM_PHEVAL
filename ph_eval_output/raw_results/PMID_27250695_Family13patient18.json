      "disease_id": "OMIM:273750",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This disorder is characterized by short stature and microcephaly, which are present in the patient. However, intellectual disability is less commonly associated, making it a less likely match."

      "disease_name": "Seckel syndrome",

      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Seckel syndrome presents with microcephaly, short stature, and intellectual disability, similar to the patient's features. However, the similar reference cases point more strongly towards autosomal recessive intellectual developmental disorders."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:216400",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This syndrome includes microcephaly and short stature, and sometimes intellectual disability. However, it typically also involves photosensitivity and premature aging, which are not mentioned in the patient's features."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:180849",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This syndrome can present with intellectual disability and microcephaly, but short stature is less common. The phenotypic match is not as strong as the top-ranked diseases."
