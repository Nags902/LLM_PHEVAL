      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Common autosomal dominant ataxia presenting with gait instability and nystagmus in adults. Age of onset typically in 30s-40s, matching patient's age."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Another common SCA with similar presentation of ataxia and nystagmus. Slightly less likely than SCA1 due to typical slower progression."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:183086",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Pure cerebellar ataxia with nystagmus, typically later onset but can present in 30s. Milder progression than other SCAs."

      "explanation": "Can present with unsteady gait and nystagmus due to cerebellar or brainstem lesions. Common in this age group but typically has relapsing-remitting course."
