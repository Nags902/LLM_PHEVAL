      "disease_id": "OMIM:164400",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Spinocerebellar ataxias can present with an unsteady gait and nystagmus, which are consistent with the patient's symptoms. Although the patient lacks other common signs, it remains a possibility given the parent's symptoms."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:229300",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Friedreich's Ataxia includes unsteady gait and can present with ocular findings such as nystagmus. While less likely, it could be considered if other symptoms develop."

      "explanation": "Multiple Sclerosis may cause unsteady gait and nystagmus, but lacks the hematological findings present in similar reference cases, lowering the likelihood."
