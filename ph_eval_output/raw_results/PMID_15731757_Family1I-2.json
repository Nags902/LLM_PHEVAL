      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features (Patent ductus arteriosus, Aortic root aneurysm, Genu valgum) overlap significantly with the reference cases diagnosed as Loeys-Dietz syndrome 2, particularly the cardiovascular and skeletal manifestations."

      "disease_name": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:609192",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient's features also align with Loeys-Dietz syndrome 1, though the reference cases for this subtype include more extensive craniofacial and connective tissue features not noted in the patient."

      "disease_name": "Marfan syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:154700",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Marfan syndrome shares some features like aortic root aneurysm and genu valgum, but the absence of other typical features (e.g., ectopia lentis, disproportionate tall stature) makes it less likely."

      "disease_name": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:130050",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This condition can present with aortic aneurysms and joint abnormalities, but the lack of skin hyperextensibility or other connective tissue signs reduces its likelihood."

      "disease_name": "Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:182212",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This syndrome includes aortic root aneurysm and genu valgum, but the absence of craniosynostosis or other distinctive features makes it a less probable diagnosis."
