      "explanation": "The combination of lipodystrophy, loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue in the limbs and trunk, diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia is strongly indicative of this condition."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition presents with generalized lipodystrophy, insulin resistance leading to diabetes, and often hypertriglyceridemia, though it's more severe and often diagnosed earlier."

      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Characterized by near-total lack of adipose tissue, leading to severe insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic involvement, aligning with many symptoms seen in the patient."

      "explanation": "Similar to Dunnigan type, but a different genetic cause; features overlap significantly with patient's symptoms, although typically affects more females."
