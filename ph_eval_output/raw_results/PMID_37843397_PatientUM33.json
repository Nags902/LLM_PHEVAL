      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While the symptoms match several features of congenital generalized lipodystrophy such as lipodystrophy and dyslipidemia, familial partial lipodystrophy has a stronger match due to the pattern of fat loss and metabolic complications."

      "explanation": "Type 3 presents with features similar to type 2, including loss of adipose tissue and metabolic issues. However, type 2 is more consistent with the typical phenotype of the patient based on reference cases."
