      "disease_id": "OMIM:604360",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This autosomal recessive complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia is an excellent fit, presenting with progressive spastic paraplegia (explaining spasticity, hyperactive DTRs, frequent falls), and frequently associated with peripheral axonal neuropathy. While acral ulceration is not a primary feature, severe sensory neuropathy can lead to trophic changes and ulceration."

      "disease_name": "Spastic Paraplegia 15, Autosomal Recessive",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:270700",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similar to SPG11, SPG15 (Kjellin syndrome) is a complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by progressive spasticity, peripheral axonal neuropathy, and often cognitive impairment. The combination of upper motor neuron signs (spasticity, hyperactive DTRs) and peripheral neuropathy, which can lead to falls and trophic changes like acral ulceration, makes it a strong candidate."

      "disease_name": "Fatty Acid Hydroxylase-Associated Neurodegeneration",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:612319",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Also known as SPG35, this condition is a form of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. It typically presents with spasticity, ataxia, and progressive peripheral axonal neuropathy, aligning well with the patient's neurological symptoms (spasticity, hyperactive DTRs, peripheral axonal neuropathy, frequent falls). Acral ulceration could be a complication of severe sensory neuropathy."

      "disease_name": "Neurodegeneration With Brain Iron Accumulation 2A",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:610217",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration, encompassing forms like infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD), often features a combination of spasticity, dystonia, and peripheral axonal neuropathy. This disease aligns with the patient's mixed central (spasticity, hyperactive DTRs) and peripheral (axonal neuropathy) neurological signs leading to frequent falls. Acral ulceration is not a classic feature but can occur due to severe sensory involvement."

      "disease_name": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Axonal, Type 2B",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:600882",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "CMT2B is a severe, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy specifically characterized by prominent sensory loss and recurrent acral ulcerations, aligning perfectly with 'Peripheral axonal neuropathy' and 'Acral ulceration.' While 'Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes' and 'Spasticity' are not typical features (reflexes are usually absent/reduced), the highly specific acral ulceration combined with axonal neuropathy warrants its inclusion as a potential, albeit less likely, diagnosis given the UMN signs."
