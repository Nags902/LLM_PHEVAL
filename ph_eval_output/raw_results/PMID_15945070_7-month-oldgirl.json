      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This condition matches several phenotypic features seen in the patient such as cerebellar and cerebral atrophy, seizures, failure to thrive, and type I transferrin isoform profile, similar to reference cases 1 and 3."

      "disease_name": "Coenzyme Q10 deficiency, primary, 7",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:616733",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The phenotype overlap includes cerebellar atrophy, seizures, failure to thrive, and hypotonia, as noted in similar manifestations in case 2. Although not all phenotypes are present, the significant overlap warrants consideration."

      "disease_name": "Congenital disorder of glycosylation, type Ia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:212065",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Although this specific subtype is not directly matched in the reference cases, the manifestations such as seizures, cerebellar atrophy, and failure to thrive align well, as congenital disorders of glycosylation often present heterogeneous phenotypes."
