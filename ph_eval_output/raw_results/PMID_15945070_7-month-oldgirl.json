      "disease_id": "OMIM:212065",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Strong match with Type I transferrin isoform profile (pathognomonic for CDG-Ia), plus neurological features (seizures, cerebellar/cerebral atrophy), failure to thrive, and fetal pericardial effusion similar to CDG-Il cases."

      "disease_name": "Congenital disorder of glycosylation, type Il",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:608779",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Reference cases show identical presentation with fetal pericardial effusion, seizures, cerebellar/cerebral atrophy, and failure to thrive. However, CDG-Il typically shows Type II transferrin pattern, not Type I."

      "disease_name": "Congenital disorder of glycosylation, type Ib",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:602579",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Another CDG subtype that can present with Type I transferrin pattern, hepatic involvement (hypoalbuminemia), and neurological symptoms, though less commonly with severe brain atrophy."

      "explanation": "Can present with Type I transferrin pattern and neurological features, but typically has more prominent immunodeficiency and less severe brain atrophy."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:236670",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Features congenital brain malformations, eye abnormalities (esotropia), and sometimes renal involvement. However, doesn't explain the Type I transferrin pattern."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:253280",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Presents with brain atrophy, eye abnormalities, and hypotonia, but lacks the characteristic transferrin abnormality and typically has more prominent muscular dystrophy."
