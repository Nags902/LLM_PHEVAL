      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Type I transferrin isoform profile is pathognomonic for CDG-Ia. The patient shows classic features including cerebellar atrophy, failure to thrive, hypotonia, seizures, and hypoalbuminemia. Polycystic kidney disease and pericardial effusion are also reported in CDG-Ia."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "CDG-Ib also presents with Type I transferrin pattern and can have similar neurological features. However, it typically has more prominent hepatic and gastrointestinal involvement rather than the cerebellar atrophy seen here."

      "explanation": "CDG-Ic shows Type I transferrin pattern with seizures and developmental delay, but typically has less severe cerebellar involvement and doesn't commonly present with renal cysts."

      "explanation": "CDG-IV can present with similar neurological features and Type I transferrin pattern, but the specific combination of polycystic kidneys and pericardial effusion is less typical."

      "explanation": "Can present with cerebellar atrophy, hypotonia, and renal cysts. However, it doesn't explain the Type I transferrin pattern or hypoalbuminemia, and typically has characteristic molar tooth sign on MRI."
