      "disease_id": "OMIM:212065",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The combination of symptoms such as cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, hypotonia, seizures, failure to thrive, and polycystic kidney dysplasia alongside a type I transferrin isoform profile strongly suggests a CDG-I disorder. The presence of pericardial effusion and esotropia also align with this possibility. CDG-I disorders often present with these neurological, developmental, and multi-organ features."

      "disease_name": "Zellweger Spectrum Disorder",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:214100",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Zellweger Spectrum Disorders exhibit features like hypotonia, seizures, cerebral atrophy, and renal involvement. The presence of a pericardial effusion and failure to thrive further support the possibility, although the type I transferrin isoform profile is less typical for this condition."

      "disease_name": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:213700",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Although Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is rare and usually presents later, infantile symptoms such as hypotonia, cerebellar atrophy, and developmental delay could align with the case. However, the lack of more characteristic features like cataracts and tendon xanthomas makes it less likely."
