      "disease_name": "Preaxial Polydactyly, Type A (Bardet-Biedl Syndrome)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:209900",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's combination of postaxial polydactyly, growth delay, nail dysplasia, anal atresia, and intellectual disability aligns with the features often seen in Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, which frequently includes polydactyly and developmental delay."

      "disease_name": "Ossicones and Subcutaneous Tissue Hamartomas (Syndrome)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:805314",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The presence of hypothalamic hamartoma along with postaxial polydactyly and growth delay suggests a potential syndrome that correlates with this combination of features."

      "disease_name": "Dandy-Walker Malformation",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:221100",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Dandy-Walker Malformation can be associated with polydactyly and hypothalamic anomalies; the case's intellectual disability and growth delay could be related signs."

      "disease_name": "Teratogenic Syndromes (e.g., Trisomy 13)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613432",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Some teratogenic syndromes include polydactyly and anal atresia, but the intellectual disability and growth delay here point to a more clearly defined genetic condition."

      "disease_name": "Acrocallosal Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:200990",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Characterized by macrocephaly, polydactyly, and developmental delay; while some features are observed, the overall constellation is not a perfect match."
