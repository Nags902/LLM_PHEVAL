      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "All three reference cases with identical phenotypic features (obesity, short metacarpal, intellectual disability) were diagnosed with this condition. The patient presents with the classic triad of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy."

      "explanation": "Related form of pseudohypoparathyroidism that can present with similar features, though typically has less prominent skeletal abnormalities than type Ia."

      "explanation": "Presents with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy features (obesity, short metacarpals, intellectual disability) but without hormone resistance, making it a differential diagnosis."

      "explanation": "Similar to acrodysostosis 1, presents with brachydactyly, intellectual disability, and can include obesity as a feature."

      "explanation": "Characterized by brachydactyly (including short metacarpals), intellectual disability, and variable obesity, though less commonly associated with obesity than pseudohypoparathyroidism."
