      "disease_id": "OMIM:176270",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Prader-Willi syndrome is associated with obesity and intellectual disability, but the presence of short metacarpal is less common, making it a less likely match compared to Pseudohypoparathyroidism Ia."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:209900",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Bardet-Biedl syndrome includes obesity and intellectual disability, but short metacarpal is not a typical feature, reducing its likelihood as the causative disease."

      "explanation": "Albright hereditary osteodystrophy is another name for Pseudohypoparathyroidism Ia, but it is less commonly used. The features match, but it is essentially the same as the top-ranked disease."
