      "disease_id": "OMIM:103580",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The phenotypic features of obesity, short metacarpal, and intellectual disability closely match those seen in reference cases diagnosed with Pseudohypoparathyroidism Ia, which is a known condition to present these symptoms."

      "disease_name": "Albright Hereditary Osteodystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:103580",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition often presents with similar features such as short metacarpals, obesity, and intellectual disability. It is sometimes classified under the broader Pseudohypoparathyroidism spectrum, which makes it relevant for consideration."

      "disease_name": "Bardet-Biedl Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:209900",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Bardet-Biedl Syndrome can feature obesity and intellectual disability. The absence of polydactyly makes it less likely but still a plausible consideration based on core symptoms."

      "disease_name": "Cohen Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:216550",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Cohen Syndrome includes obesity and intellectual disability as key features. It is considered less likely due to additional expected features like microcephaly and retinal dystrophy not being present."
