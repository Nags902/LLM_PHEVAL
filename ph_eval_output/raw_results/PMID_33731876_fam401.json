      "explanation": "Severe epileptic encephalopathy with developmental delay and multiple seizure types. While infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia are less typical, they can occur. CSWS can develop in later stages."

      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Characterized by continuous spike-wave during slow sleep with epileptic encephalopathy and developmental regression. The early features of infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia suggest this may be secondary ESES."

      "explanation": "Often evolves from West syndrome. Features tonic seizures, developmental delay, and can show CSWS pattern. The presence of hypsarrhythmia suggests earlier West syndrome."
