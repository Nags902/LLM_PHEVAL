      "disease_id": "OMIM:603387",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The presence of hydrocephalus, intellectual disability, global developmental delay, and facial dysmorphism aligns with Megalencephaly-Polymicrogyria-Polydactyly-Hydrocephalus Syndrome 1. Villous hypertrophy of choroid plexus and visual impairment also support this possibility."

      "disease_name": "Megalencephaly-Capillary Malformation Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:602501",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This syndrome is characterized by overgrowth, neurological symptoms like intellectual disability, and possibly hydrocephalus. Some facial features and developmental delays may overlap with the patient's symptoms."

      "disease_name": "Sotos Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:117550",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Sotos Syndrome exhibits characteristics such as intellectual disability, developmental delay, distinctive facial features, and potential visual issues, which are similar to the patient's presentation."

      "disease_name": "Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607014",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Although not highly specific, features such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, and facial dysmorphism might hint at MPS I, but the lack of classical coarse facies reduces confidence."
