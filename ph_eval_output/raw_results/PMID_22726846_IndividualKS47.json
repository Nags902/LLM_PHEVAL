      "disease_name": "Choroid Plexus Papilloma, Familial",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:600705",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The presence of 'villous hypertrophy of choroid plexus' (HP:0012422) is highly characteristic of a choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) or a similar benign overgrowth, which is the most common cause of hydrocephalus (HP:0000238) due to CSF overproduction. Intellectual disability (HP:0001249), global developmental delay (HP:0001263), and visual impairment (HP:0000505) with high myopia (HP:0011003) can all be secondary complications of chronic hydrocephalus. While the specific facial features (upslanted palpebral fissure, midface retrusion, protruding tongue) are not typical for isolated CPP, a rare underlying genetic predisposition to CPP that includes these features cannot be excluded, or they could represent co-occurring findings in a complex presentation."

      "disease_name": "Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I, Hurler Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607014",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (Hurler Syndrome) accounts for a significant number of the patient's features. It typically presents with intellectual disability (HP:0001249), global developmental delay (HP:0001263), hydrocephalus (HP:0000238, often communicating due to impaired CSF absorption), visual impairment (HP:0000505) including high myopia (HP:0011003) due to corneal clouding or retinal degeneration, midface retrusion (HP:0011800), and protruding tongue (HP:0010808) due to macroglossia. Although 'villous hypertrophy of choroid plexus' (HP:0012422) is not a classical hallmark of MPS I, other CNS abnormalities like choroid plexus cysts and generalized ventricular enlargement are known. The overall coarse features and progressive neurodevelopmental course fit well."

      "disease_name": "Down Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:190685",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21) strongly matches several key phenotypic features including intellectual disability (HP:0001249), global developmental delay (HP:0001263), upslanted palpebral fissures (HP:0000582), midface retrusion (HP:0011800) (midface hypoplasia), and a protruding tongue (HP:0010808) (relative macroglossia). Visual impairment (HP:0000505) and high myopia (HP:0011003) are also very common. While hydrocephalus (HP:0000238) is less common and not typically due to villous hypertrophy of the choroid plexus (HP:0012422) (though choroid plexus cysts are a known prenatal finding), the strong overall constellation of highly characteristic features makes Down Syndrome an important differential diagnosis."
