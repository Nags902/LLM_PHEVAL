      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with visual impairment, intellectual disability, and developmental delays, which are consistent with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome. The myopia and potential hydrocephalus align with features reported in literature on this syndrome."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:607056",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The combination of intellectual disability, hydrocephalus, and dysmorphic features such as upslanted palpebral fissures makes Pachygyria a candidate, especially given the developmental delays noted."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:618612",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This syndrome presents with developmental delay and intellectual disability, along with craniofacial dysmorphism such as upslanted palpebral fissures and midface retrusion, which correlates with this patient's features."

      "explanation": "The patient\u2019s high myopia and eye abnormalities may point towards Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome, though the intellectual disability is not as typical for this disorder."
