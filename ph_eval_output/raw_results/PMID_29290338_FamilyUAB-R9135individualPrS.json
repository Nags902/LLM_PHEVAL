      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius Syndrome (NF1-like syndrome) shares some features with NF1, such as caf\u00e9-au-lait macules and freckling, but specifically *does not* include neurofibromas (cutaneous or plexiform). While often considered in the differential diagnosis of NF1-like presentations, the presence of a plexiform neurofibroma makes this diagnosis highly unlikely."

      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:101000",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is characterized by the development of vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas. Plexiform neurofibromas are not a feature of NF2. This diagnosis is highly improbable based on the provided symptom but is included due to its classification as a major neurofibromatosis and potential for other nerve sheath tumors."
