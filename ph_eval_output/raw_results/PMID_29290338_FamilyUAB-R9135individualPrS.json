      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While Schwannomatosis is primarily characterized by multiple schwannomas, cases can occasionally include plexiform-like neurofibromas, although this association is less common than with NF1."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:101000",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "NF2 is primarily characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas, not plexiform neurofibromas, but NF2 can have overlapping features with NF1 in certain rare presentations."
