      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The presence of plexiform neurofibromas is highly indicative of Neurofibromatosis type 1, supported by reference cases with similar phenotypic features."

      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:101000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While NF2 is primarily associated with bilateral vestibular schwannomas, it can also involve nerve sheath tumors, making it a relevant consideration."

      "disease_name": "Schwannomatosis",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:162091",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Schwannomatosis involves multiple schwannomas, which can include neurofibromas; though less likely, it is still associated with similar tumor formation."

      "disease_name": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:605282",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "TSC can present with various tumors, including subcutaneous nodules and various other neurocutaneous manifestations, making it a lower probability but relevant possibility."
