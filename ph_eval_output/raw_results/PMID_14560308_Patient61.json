      "disease_id": "OMIM:305400",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Aarskog-Scott syndrome matches most of the phenotypic features observed in the patient, including hypertelorism, ptosis, brachydactyly, camptodactyly, joint hypermobility, syndactyly, short stature, intellectual disability, and shawl scrotum. Reference cases also confirm a high likelihood of this diagnosis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Noonan syndrome shares several overlapping features such as hypertelorism, ptosis, short stature, and intellectual disability. However, it lacks some specific features like shawl scrotum, making it less likely compared to Aarskog-Scott syndrome."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:268310",
      "score": 0.333333,
      "explanation": "Robinow syndrome is a possible condition with overlapping features such as hypertelorism, short stature, and limb abnormalities. However, the absence of key symptoms like shawl scrotum reduces its ranking."
