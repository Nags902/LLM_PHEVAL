      "disease_name": "CDK13-related disorder",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:616644",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This disorder presents an excellent match with the patient's comprehensive phenotype, including intellectual disability, global developmental delay, autistic behavior, ADHD, short stature, microcephaly, motor and speech delays, and recurrent otitis media. Crucially, the presence of a distinctive triangular face and anteverted nares are characteristic features of CDK13-related disorder, making it the most consistent fit."

      "disease_name": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:270400",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome is a strong candidate given the broad overlap of features. It typically includes intellectual disability, global developmental delay, autistic features, short stature, microcephaly, motor and speech delays, recurrent otitis media, and anteverted nares. While a 'triangular face' isn't a primary hallmark, the combination of microcephaly and certain facial characteristics (e.g., narrow forehead, micrognathia) can contribute to such an appearance."

    {
      "disease_name": "Mowat-Wilson Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:235730",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Mowat-Wilson Syndrome aligns well with several key features observed, such as intellectual disability (often severe), global developmental delay, microcephaly, short stature, motor and speech delays, and anteverted nares. Autistic behavior is also commonly reported. The facial gestalt can present with a somewhat triangular appearance due to a pointed chin, further supporting its consideration."

    {
      "disease_name": "Kleefstra Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:610253",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Kleefstra Syndrome shares a significant number of the patient's features, including intellectual disability, global developmental delay, autistic behavior, short stature, variable microcephaly, motor and speech delays, recurrent otitis media, and anteverted nares. While a 'triangular face' is not classically described, the facial dysmorphism is broad and could manifest this way, making it a plausible candidate."

    {
      "disease_name": "Kabuki Syndrome type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:147920",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Kabuki Syndrome type 1 presents with many overlapping features such as intellectual disability, global developmental delay, autistic behavior, short stature, motor and speech delays, recurrent otitis media, and anteverted nares. Although microcephaly and a distinct triangular face are not typical hallmark features, the overall constellation of neurodevelopmental and physical traits, particularly recurrent infections and anteverted nares, warrants its inclusion as a potential, albeit less precise, match."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Kabuki Syndrome type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300867",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Similar to Kabuki Syndrome type 1, this subtype shares core features including intellectual disability, global developmental delay, autistic behavior, short stature, motor and speech delays, recurrent otitis media, and anteverted nares. As with type 1, microcephaly and a triangular face are not commonly described, but the extensive phenotypic overlap and the instruction to consider all subtypes justify its inclusion. Both Kabuki types are clinically very similar, hence their shared score."
