      "disease_name": "Angelman syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:105830",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features such as infantile spasms, severe intellectual disability, absent speech, motor stereotypy, and microcephaly are highly suggestive of Angelman syndrome. The presence of seizures and global developmental delay further supports this diagnosis."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Rett syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312750",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Rett syndrome is characterized by severe intellectual disability, absent speech, motor stereotypies, and seizures. However, the absence of regression and the presence of microcephaly from an early age make Angelman syndrome more likely."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "CDKL5 deficiency disorder",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300672",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This disorder presents with early-onset seizures, severe intellectual disability, and developmental delay. The patient's infantile spasms and other seizure types are consistent with CDKL5 deficiency, but the absence of regression and other specific features makes it less likely than Angelman syndrome."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "FOXG1 syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613454",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "FOXG1 syndrome includes microcephaly, severe intellectual disability, absent speech, and seizures. The patient's features overlap, but the presence of precocious puberty and other specific features are not typical for FOXG1 syndrome."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "MECP2 duplication syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300260",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This syndrome involves severe intellectual disability, seizures, and motor abnormalities. However, the patient's features are more aligned with Angelman syndrome, and MECP2 duplication syndrome is less likely given the absence of recurrent infections and other typical features."
