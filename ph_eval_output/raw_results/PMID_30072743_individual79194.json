      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient shares several phenotypic features with Case 2, which was diagnosed as Leber congenital amaurosis 6. The presence of peripheral retinal atrophy and bull's eye maculopathy increase the likelihood of this condition. Both cases exhibit similarities such as nystagmus and reduced visual acuity."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similarities exist with Case 1 and Case 3, both diagnosed with Cone-rod dystrophy 13. Key overlapping symptoms include nystagmus and reduced visual acuity. However, some symptoms like bone spicule pigmentation are not observed in the current patient, making it a second option."

      "disease_name": "Retinitis Pigmentosa 19",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601718",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Retinitis pigmentosa can present with nystagmus and reduced visual acuity, along with retinal atrophy similar to the patient's presentation. However, the lack of characteristic bone spicule pigmentation reduces its ranking."
