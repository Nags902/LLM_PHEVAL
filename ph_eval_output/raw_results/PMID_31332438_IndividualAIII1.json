      "disease_id": "OMIM:612114",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms closely match the similar cases presented, including lower limb amyotrophy, motor axonal neuropathy, impaired vibratory sensation, and frequent falls. This disease is characterized by the combination of lower limb weakness and gait disturbances."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:118210",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "CMT2A can present with motor axonal neuropathy, lower limb weakness, and unsteady gait, similar to the patient's features. While this condition typically involves more upper limb symptoms, it shares enough similarity to be considered."

      "disease_name": "Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA1)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:253300",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Although traditionally characterized by severe weakness and atrophy, this condition can manifest similar lower limb symptoms as seen in the patient. It's ranked lower due to the age and absence of classic presentation for this type in adulthood."
