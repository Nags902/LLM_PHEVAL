      "disease_name": "Neuronopathy, distal hereditary motor, autosomal dominant 11",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:618411",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "All three reference cases with similar phenotypes were diagnosed with this condition. The patient shares key features including motor axonal neuropathy, lower limb amyotrophy, muscle weakness, unsteady gait, impaired vibratory sensation, and frequent falls."

      "disease_name": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:118210",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "CMT2A1 presents with motor axonal neuropathy, distal muscle weakness and atrophy, gait disturbance, and sensory impairment. The patient's phenotype fits well, though lacks some typical features like pes cavus seen in reference cases."
    },

      "disease_name": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A2A",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:609260",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Another CMT2 subtype with autosomal dominant inheritance presenting with axonal motor neuropathy, distal weakness, and gait problems. Compatible with patient's presentation but less specific match than dHMN11."

      "disease_name": "Neuronopathy, distal hereditary motor, type II",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:608634",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Classic distal HMN with motor axonal neuropathy and distal weakness. Patient shows these features but also has sensory involvement (impaired vibration), which is less typical for pure motor neuronopathy."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:605588",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "CMT2B1 can present with axonal neuropathy, distal weakness, and sensory loss. The patient's age and gender fit, though this subtype often has more prominent sensory features than shown."

    {
      "disease_name": "Spinal muscular atrophy, distal, autosomal dominant 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:182960",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "DSMAD1 presents with distal muscle weakness and atrophy, primarily affecting lower limbs. However, it typically lacks the sensory involvement and axonal neuropathy seen in this patient."
