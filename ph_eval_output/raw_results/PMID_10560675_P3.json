      "disease_id": "OMIM:306400",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Given the chronic nature of the infections and respiratory issues, this disease could also be considered due to potential immune system dysfunction leading to chronic respiratory issues."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:607594",

      "disease_id": "OMIM:219700",

      "explanation": "The presence of bronchitis and sinusitis may point towards cystic fibrosis, which is known for causing respiratory complications due to thick mucus production, although nasal polyposis is less common."
