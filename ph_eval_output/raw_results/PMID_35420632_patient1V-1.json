      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Classic telomeropathy presenting with short telomeres, pulmonary fibrosis (UIP pattern), hepatic complications including nodular regenerative hyperplasia, and portal hypertension. The combination of lung and liver involvement with short telomeres is pathognomonic."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "TERT mutation-related telomeropathy with similar presentation to DC1, including pulmonary fibrosis and hepatic disease. The age of onset (32 years) fits with adult-onset telomeropathy."

      "explanation": "TINF2 mutation-related telomeropathy, though typically presents earlier in life. Can cause severe pulmonary fibrosis and liver disease with short telomeres."

      "explanation": "TERT-related adult-onset telomeropathy with prominent pulmonary fibrosis. The thrombocytopenia suggests bone marrow involvement, though liver disease is less common."
