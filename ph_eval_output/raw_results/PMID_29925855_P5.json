    {
      "disease_name": "Ataxia, early-onset, with oculomotor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:208920",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypes of ataxia and hypotonia align with similar reference cases diagnosed with this condition. Although not all features are present, the combination most closely matches the phenotypic pattern seen in the reference cases."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Dystonia 37, early-onset, with striatal lesions",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:612716",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The presence of dystonia in the patient, along with ataxia and hypotonia, is similar to symptoms seen in reference case 3. This similarity suggests a possibility, though the case lacks intellectual disability and other features typical for this condition."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Ataxia-telangiectasia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:208900",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Ataxia-telangiectasia shares symptoms of ataxia and hypotonia, commonly onset in childhood. Though some typical signs like telangiectasia and immunodeficiency are missing, it remains a potential candidate based on the general symptom overlap."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Rett syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312750",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "The combination of ataxia, hypotonia, dystonia, and strabismus is notable. Rett syndrome, while primarily affecting females, can rarely show overlapping symptoms. The gender of the patient makes this less likely, but it remains a possibility."
