      "disease_id": "OMIM:260300",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Young-onset parkinsonism with pyramidal signs (Babinski, hyperreflexia) closely matches reference cases 2 and 3. The combination of parkinsonism, bradykinesia, rigidity with upper motor neuron signs is characteristic of PARK15."

      "disease_name": "Spastic paraplegia 78, autosomal recessive",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:617225",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Shows similar pyramidal signs and parkinsonism as reference case 1, with cerebellar atrophy. However, lacks many features present in the reference case like dementia, dystonia, and spastic paraplegia."

      "disease_name": "Kufor-Rakeb syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:606693",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Early-onset parkinsonism with pyramidal signs is characteristic. This autosomal recessive parkinsonian syndrome presents with rigidity, bradykinesia, and upper motor neuron signs in young adults."

      "disease_name": "Perry syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:168605",

      "disease_id": "OMIM:183090",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with parkinsonism, cerebellar atrophy, and pyramidal signs. The positive Romberg sign suggests proprioceptive dysfunction which can occur in SCA2."

      "explanation": "Presents with parkinsonism, cerebellar atrophy, and pyramidal signs, but typically has later onset than 27 years and includes autonomic dysfunction not mentioned here."
