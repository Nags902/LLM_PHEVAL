      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits some overlapping features such as Parkinsonism, Bradykinesia, Hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and Cerebellar atrophy, which are also seen in Spastic paraplegia 78, though not all features are present."

      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The patient's Cerebellar atrophy, Rigidity, and Hyperreflexia suggest a possible spinocerebellar ataxia, though other features like Parkinsonism are less commonly associated."

      "explanation": "The patient's Parkinsonism, Bradykinesia, and Rigidity could align with multiple system atrophy, but the presence of Cerebellar atrophy and Hyperreflexia is less typical."
