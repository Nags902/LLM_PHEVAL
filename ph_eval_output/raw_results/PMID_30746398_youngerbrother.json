      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits key symptoms of Parkinsonism, bradykinesia, rigidity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski sign, which are characteristic of Parkinson Disease 15. The reference cases with similar phenotypic presentation were also diagnosed with this condition."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:617225",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition was diagnosed in a reference case with overlapping features such as Babinski sign, hyperreflexia, cerebellar atrophy, and bradykinesia. Although not all phonotypical features match, the presence of cerebellar atrophy and Babinski sign provides a reasonable link."

      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar atrophy, and positive Romberg sign aligns with multiple system atrophy, which can present with parkinsonian symptoms and cerebellar dysfunction."
