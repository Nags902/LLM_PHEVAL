      "disease_id": "OMIM:617920",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with hepatic and renal amyloidosis, which are also features of hereditary systemic amyloidosis 3, though the absence of cardiac amyloidosis makes this less likely than hereditary systemic amyloidosis 5."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:105200",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Familial visceral amyloidosis can present with renal and hepatic involvement, but the lack of specific mention of other visceral involvement makes this less likely."
