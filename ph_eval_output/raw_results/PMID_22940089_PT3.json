      "disease_id": "OMIM:209900",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathy characterized by obesity, postaxial polydactyly, retinal dystrophy (nyctalopia and reduced visual acuity), and other features. The presence of nyctalopia, postaxial polydactyly, obesity, and visual impairment strongly suggests BBS."

      "disease_name": "Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:203800",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome shares features like obesity, reduced visual acuity, and nyctalopia with the patient's phenotype. However, the absence of hearing loss and diabetes, which are common in Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome, makes it less likely than BBS."

    {
      "disease_name": "Cohen Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:216550",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Cohen Syndrome can present with obesity, reduced visual acuity, and ptosis. However, the lack of intellectual disability and neutropenia, which are hallmark features, reduces its likelihood."

      "disease_name": "Leber Congenital Amaurosis",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:204000",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is associated with severe visual impairment and nyctalopia. However, the presence of polydactyly and obesity is atypical, making LCA less likely."

    {
      "disease_name": "Prader-Willi Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:176270",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Prader-Willi Syndrome is characterized by obesity and hypotonia, but the presence of polydactyly and nyctalopia is not typical, reducing its relevance."
