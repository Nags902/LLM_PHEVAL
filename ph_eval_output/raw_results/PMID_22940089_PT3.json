      "disease_id": "OMIM:209900",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms, particularly postaxial polydactyly, reduced visual acuity, nyctalopia, and obesity, align closely with those observed in several reference cases diagnosed with Bardet-Biedl syndrome."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Alstr\u00f6m syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:203800",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Alstr\u00f6m syndrome shares many features with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, including obesity, reduced visual acuity, and potentially polydactyly, making it a possible but less likely diagnosis given the absence of cardiomyopathy and hearing loss."

    {
      "disease_name": "Laurence-Moon syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:245800",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Laurence-Moon syndrome is similar to Bardet-Biedl syndrome but is rarer and usually includes spastic paraplegia, which is not present here, thus being a less likely match."
