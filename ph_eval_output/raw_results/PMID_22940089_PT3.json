      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features, including nyctalopia, postaxial polydactyly, reduced visual acuity, and obesity, closely match the symptoms of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. The similar reference cases also strongly support this diagnosis."

      "explanation": "Alstr\u00f6m syndrome can present with obesity, reduced visual acuity, and nyctalopia, but it typically lacks postaxial polydactyly, making it a less likely diagnosis."
