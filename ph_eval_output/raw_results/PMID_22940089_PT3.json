      "disease_name": "Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:209900",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome (Bardet-Biedl syndrome) frequently presents with obesity, polydactyly, retinal dystrophy (which can cause nyctalopia and reduced visual acuity), and often includes features related to vision like ptosis and astigmatism. The combination of these features makes it the most likely candidate."

    {
      "disease_name": "Alstrom syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:203800",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Alstrom syndrome includes features such as obesity, visual impairment including reduced acuity and potentially nyctalopia, though polydactyly is not commonly associated. Ranked lower due to the absence of polydactyly."

    {
      "disease_name": "Meckel syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:249000",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Meckel syndrome often presents with polydactyly and may include other overlapping features like ptosis. However, it is typically associated with more severe developmental anomalies, reducing its likelihood."

    {
      "disease_name": "Senior-Loken syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:266900",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Senior-Loken syndrome can present with retinal dystrophy leading to nyctalopia and reduced visual acuity. However, it is primarily associated with kidney diseases, not obesity or polydactyly, making it less likely."
