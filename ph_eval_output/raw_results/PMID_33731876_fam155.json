      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Perfect match with reference cases 1 and 2, sharing all key features including cerebral atrophy, burst suppression EEG, epileptic encephalopathy, focal tonic seizures, infantile spasms, severe intellectual disability, and multifocal epileptiform discharges."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Strong overlap with reference case 3, sharing burst suppression EEG, infantile spasms, focal tonic seizures, cerebral atrophy, and severe intellectual disability. Missing some features but shows significant phenotypic similarity."

      "disease_name": "Ohtahara syndrome (Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Classic features of burst suppression on EEG, infantile spasms, and severe epileptic encephalopathy are consistent with this diagnosis. Multiple genetic causes can lead to this phenotype."

      "disease_name": "West syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Characterized by infantile spasms, developmental regression, and EEG abnormalities. The burst suppression pattern and severe intellectual disability suggest a more severe form evolving from or overlapping with Ohtahara syndrome."

      "disease_name": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 1 (ARX-related)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with infantile spasms, severe intellectual disability, and various seizure types. The burst suppression pattern is compatible with severe ARX mutations."
