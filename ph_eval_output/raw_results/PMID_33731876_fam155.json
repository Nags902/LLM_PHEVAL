      "disease_id": "OMIM:613721",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "There is a strong overlap of phenotypic features such as cerebral atrophy, EEG with burst suppression, epileptic encephalopathy, focal tonic seizures, generalized myoclonic seizures, infantile spasms, severe intellectual disability, and multifocal epileptiform discharges, which align with similar reference cases diagnosed with this condition."

      "disease_name": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 4",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:612164",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 4 also includes features such as epileptic encephalopathy and severe intellectual disability, this condition is somewhat less common for burst suppression patterns. However, it remains a plausible consideration given the complex seizure types."

      "disease_name": "West Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Characterized by infantile spasms and intellectual disability, which are present in the patient. The presence of multifocal epileptiform discharges also supports consideration, though the full spectrum of features is broader."
