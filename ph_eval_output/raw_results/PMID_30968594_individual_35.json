      "explanation": "The patient's features of clitoral hypertrophy and hyperpigmentation of the skin are highly consistent with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, as seen in all similar reference cases provided."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This form of CAH can also present with virilization (clitoral hypertrophy) and hyperpigmentation, though it is less common than 21-hydroxylase deficiency."

      "explanation": "This rare condition can present with hyperpigmentation and ambiguous genitalia, though it is less likely than CAH given the similar cases."
