      "explanation": "Classic presentation with virilization (clitoral hypertrophy) in females and hyperpigmentation due to elevated ACTH. This is the most common form of CAH."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:202010",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Also presents with virilization and hyperpigmentation, but less common than 21-hydroxylase deficiency. May have associated hypertension."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:201810",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Can cause mild virilization in females and hyperpigmentation, though typically presents with salt-wasting crisis early in life."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:613546",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Causes virilization in females due to inability to convert androgens to estrogens. Hyperpigmentation is less typical but possible."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can cause precocious puberty with virilization and caf\u00e9-au-lait spots (hyperpigmentation), though the pigmentation pattern is usually more specific."

      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Can cause elevated ACTH leading to hyperpigmentation and androgen excess causing virilization, though this is a rare condition."
