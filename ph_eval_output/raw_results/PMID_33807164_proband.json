      "disease_name": "Cutis Laxa, Autosomal Dominant, Type IB",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:123700",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The presence of cutis laxa, joint hypermobility, thin skin, and facial features such as downturned corners of the mouth are strongly indicative of this condition. The phenotypes align well, although not perfectly, with this rare disorder."

      "disease_name": "Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Classic Type",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:130000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The combination of joint hypermobility, skin involvement (thin skin, easy bruising), and facial characteristics, such as a long face and malocclusion, suggests a possibility of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome."
    },

      "disease_name": "Craniosynostosis 2, Amnion Rupture Sequence",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:618509",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Telecanthus, downturned corners of the mouth, and dental malocclusion are consistent, though not specific, features that could be seen in craniosynostosis-related conditions."

      "disease_name": "Loeys-Dietz Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:609192",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Although classical signs include arterial involvement, the phenotype overlaps with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, particularly with facial features and joint hypermobility."

    {
      "disease_name": "Marfan Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:154700",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "While phenotypically similar through features such as a long face, high anterior hairline, and joint hypermobility, Marfan syndrome doesn't completely align with all features such as cutis laxa or congenital diaphragmatic hernia."
