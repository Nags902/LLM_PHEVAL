      "disease_id": "OMIM:142900",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features, such as cardiac defects (atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects) and limb anomalies (absent thumb, absent radius), align closely with Holt-Oram syndrome, as seen in the similar reference cases diagnosed with this condition."

      "disease_name": "TAR syndrome (Thrombocytopenia-Absent Radius syndrome)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:274000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "TAR syndrome is characterized by the absence of the radius and thumb abnormalities, matching some of the patient's limb phenotypes. Although more frequently associated with thrombocytopenia, the presence of limb defects merits its consideration."
