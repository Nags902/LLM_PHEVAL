      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's presentation of multiple cardiac defects (atrial and ventricular septal defects) alongside upper limb anomalies (absent thumb and absent radius) matches closely with reference cases diagnosed with Holt-Oram syndrome."

      "disease_name": "Campomelic Dysplasia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:114290",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition involves skeletal deformities and can present with upper limb defects. The presence of congenital heart defects may also be associated, making it a relevant but less likely diagnosis compared to Holt-Oram syndrome."

      "disease_name": "Robert's Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:268300",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Associated with limb malformations and cardiac defects, but it generally includes more severe malformations than those presented here, thus it ranks below Holt-Oram syndrome."
