      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The phenotypic features of the patient closely match those of the reference cases that were all diagnosed with Glutaricaciduria, type I, including macrocephaly, cerebral atrophy, subdural hemorrhage, glutaric aciduria, and dystonia."

      "disease_name": "Canavan Disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:271900",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While uncommon, Canavan Disease can present with macrocephaly and cerebral atrophy. It is less likely than Glutaricaciduria, type I due to the lack of glutaric aciduria in its phenotype."

      "disease_name": "Alexander Disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:203450",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Though not a perfect match, Alexander Disease is considered due to the presence of macrocephaly and cerebral atrophy, but the absence of glutaric aciduria in its presentation makes it less probable."
