      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Although less common, Glutaric aciduria type II shares some symptomatic overlap with Glutaric aciduria type I. The presence of dystonia and metabolic issues supports this possibility."

      "explanation": "This condition may relate to metabolic derangements causing symptoms such as dystonia and macrocephaly, although it's less directly aligned with the glutaric acid levels noted."
