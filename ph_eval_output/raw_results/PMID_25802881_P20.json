      "disease_id": "OMIM:103580",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features (subcutaneous ossification, intellectual disability, and elevated parathyroid hormone) closely match the reference cases, all diagnosed with Pseudohypoparathyroidism Ia. This condition is characterized by resistance to parathyroid hormone, leading to these symptoms."

      "disease_name": "Pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:603233",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This subtype also involves parathyroid hormone resistance but typically lacks the physical features like subcutaneous ossification. However, it is still a consideration given the elevated PTH levels and intellectual disability."

      "disease_name": "Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:612463",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "This condition presents with subcutaneous ossification and intellectual disability but usually has normal PTH levels. It is less likely but included due to some overlapping features."

      "disease_name": "Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:135100",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This disease involves progressive ossification of soft tissues, which could explain subcutaneous ossification. However, it does not typically involve elevated PTH levels or intellectual disability, making it a less likely match."

    {
      "disease_name": "Albright hereditary osteodystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:103580",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This is often associated with Pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia and shares many features, but it is more of a descriptive term for the phenotype rather than a distinct diagnosis."
