      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Perfect match with all three reference cases showing identical phenotypes. Classic triad of subcutaneous ossification, intellectual disability, and elevated PTH. Caused by GNAS mutations affecting PTH receptor signaling."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:612462",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similar to PHP1A with subcutaneous ossification and PTH resistance, but typically milder intellectual disability. Caused by GNAS mutations affecting different domains."

      "disease_name": "Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:612463",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Features Albright hereditary osteodystrophy phenotype including subcutaneous ossification, but typically without PTH resistance. The elevated PTH in this patient makes it less likely."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:101800",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Can present with subcutaneous ossification, intellectual disability, and hormone resistance including PTH. However, typically has more prominent skeletal abnormalities."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:166350",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Features progressive subcutaneous ossification due to GNAS mutations, but typically lacks PTH resistance and intellectual disability, making it less likely given the patient's presentation."
