      "disease_id": "OMIM:103580",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with subcutaneous ossification, intellectual disability, and elevated circulating parathyroid hormone levels, matching the phenotypic features of Pseudohypoparathyroidism Ia. Reference cases show identical symptomatology leading to a diagnosis of Pseudohypoparathyroidism Ia."

    {
      "disease_name": "Pseudohypoparathyroidism Ib",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:603233",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Although the patient shares some clinical features with Pseudohypoparathyroidism Ib, such as elevated circulating parathyroid hormone levels, subcutaneous ossification, and intellectual disability, the classical presentation of this subtype mainly involves renal resistance to parathyroid hormone and lacks some specific features of type Ia."

      "disease_name": "Albright Hereditary Osteodystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:103580",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Albright Hereditary Osteodystrophy, which overlaps clinically with Pseudohypoparathyroidism, presents with subcutaneous ossifications and intellectual disability. Without additional features like hormone resistance typically present in Pseudohypoparathyroidism, it's considered a differential yet less probable."
