      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits several features commonly associated with Noonan Syndrome, including hypertelorism, patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of aorta, cryptorchidism, delayed speech and language development, and global developmental delay. The presence of cardiac anomalies and facial dysmorphisms strongly suggests this diagnosis."

    {
      "disease_name": "KBG Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:148050",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient's features such as global developmental delay, delayed speech and language development, cryptorchidism, and delayed skeletal maturation overlap with KBG Syndrome. However, the absence of macrodontia and other specific KBG features makes this less likely than Noonan Syndrome."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Cardiac, facial, and digital anomalies with developmental delay",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:618164",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The patient shares some features with the similar reference cases, such as patent ductus arteriosus, cryptorchidism, and global developmental delay. However, the absence of some key features like feeding difficulties and craniosynostosis reduces the likelihood."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Turner Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300000",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "The patient's short neck, coarctation of aorta, and hypothyroidism are seen in Turner Syndrome. However, the patient's gender (female) and absence of other typical features like lymphedema make this less likely."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Williams Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:194050",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "The patient's hypertelorism, delayed speech and language development, and cardiovascular anomalies could suggest Williams Syndrome. However, the absence of supravalvular aortic stenosis and characteristic elfin facies reduces the likelihood."
