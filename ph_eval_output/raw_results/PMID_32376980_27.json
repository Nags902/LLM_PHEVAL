      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This is the most common and prototypic form of Noonan Syndrome, caused by PTPN11 mutations. Its clinical features align exceptionally well with nearly all of the patient's phenotypes, including the distinctive craniofacial dysmorphism (short neck, microretrognathia, hypertelorism, telecanthus, blepharophimosis, depressed nasal bridge, prominent forehead, abnormal helix morphology, delayed eruption of teeth), characteristic cardiac defects (patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of aorta), developmental delays (global and speech), skeletal anomalies (pectus carinatum, delayed skeletal maturation), and highly suggestive findings like cryptorchidism in a male patient. Hypothyroidism is a less common but reported association within the Noonan spectrum."

      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome 4",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:616559",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome 4, caused by RIT1 mutations, is another significant genetic cause within the Noonan spectrum. It presents with a very similar constellation of features to the patient, including characteristic facial dysmorphism, diverse congenital heart defects (including those seen here), developmental delay, and cryptorchidism. The overall clinical picture is highly consistent with this subtype, making it a strong second candidate."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:610732",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome 2, resulting from SOS1 mutations, is a common subtype of Noonan Syndrome that shares the core features observed in the patient. These include the characteristic facial features, various congenital heart defects (often pulmonary valve stenosis, but others occur), developmental delay, and skeletal anomalies. The broad phenotypic overlap across these key features makes it a highly relevant differential diagnosis within the Noonan spectrum."

      "disease_name": "Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:115150",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "As another disorder of the RAS/MAPK pathway (RASopathy), Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) Syndrome shares significant phenotypic overlap with Noonan Syndrome. This includes developmental delay, various congenital heart defects, and similar craniofacial features such as hypertelorism, prominent forehead, and depressed nasal bridge. While CFC typically involves more pronounced ectodermal abnormalities (e.g., hyperkeratosis, ichthyosis, sparse hair) not explicitly mentioned in this patient's features, the core systemic manifestations make it a strong differential diagnosis."

    {
      "disease_name": "Costello Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:218040",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Costello Syndrome is also a RASopathy and shares some broad features like developmental delay, congenital heart defects (e.g., pulmonary stenosis), and growth delay. However, it often presents with more distinctive coarse facial features, papillomas, loose skin, and typically more severe intellectual disability and feeding difficulties compared to Noonan Syndrome. While some overlap exists due to shared pathway etiology, the specific constellation of features in this patient fits Noonan Syndrome more precisely."
