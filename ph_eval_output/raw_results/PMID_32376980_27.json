      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Many phenotypic features such as short neck, hypertelorism, coarctation of aorta, and developmental delay are consistent with Noonan Syndrome, specifically type 1 due to PTPN11 mutations."

    {
      "disease_name": "Turner Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300135",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Turner Syndrome can present with features such as short neck, heart defects, and delayed development, fitting part of the patient's presentation. However, the presence of cryptorchidism makes this less likely unless mosaicism is considered."

    {
      "disease_name": "KBG Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:148050",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "KBG Syndrome shares several features with the patient, including global developmental delay, delayed skeletal maturation, and prominent forehead, as seen in Case 3."

    {
      "disease_name": "Silver-Russell Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:180860",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This syndrome can present with short stature, speech delay, and distinct craniofacial features like a prominent forehead and microretrognathia, aligning partially with the phenotypic profile."

    {
      "disease_name": "CHARGE Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:214800",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "CHARGE syndrome includes heart defects, delayed development, and craniofacial anomalies, which are part of the observed features, though less perfectly than Noonan Syndrome types."
