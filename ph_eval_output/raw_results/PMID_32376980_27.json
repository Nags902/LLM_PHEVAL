      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Strong match with cardiac defects (PDA, coarctation), facial dysmorphism (hypertelorism, depressed nasal bridge, prominent forehead), short neck, pectus carinatum, cryptorchidism, and developmental delays. PTPN11 mutation-associated form."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:605275",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similar phenotypic profile to NS1 with cardiac anomalies, facial features, and developmental delays. Associated with KRAS mutations, may have slightly different cardiac manifestations."

      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome 3",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:609942",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "KRAS-related variant presenting with typical Noonan features including cardiac defects, facial dysmorphism, and developmental delays, though specific cardiac lesions may vary."

      "disease_name": "Turner Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300082",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Shares several features including short neck, coarctation of aorta, hypertelorism, and hypothyroidism. However, patient is male (cryptorchidism present), making this less likely but mosaic forms possible."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:610733",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "SOS1-associated Noonan syndrome with characteristic facial features, cardiac defects, and developmental delays. May have higher frequency of ectodermal abnormalities."

      "explanation": "PTPN11-related disorder with cardiac defects and facial features similar to Noonan syndrome, though typically includes lentigines which are not mentioned in this case."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:218040",
      "score": 0.11,
      "explanation": "RASopathy with cardiac defects, facial dysmorphism, and developmental delays. HRAS mutations typically cause more severe phenotype with increased tumor risk."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:147920",
      "score": 0.1,
      "explanation": "Features blepharophimosis, cardiac defects, developmental delays, and skeletal abnormalities. KMT2D-associated form, though typical facial gestalt differs from presented features."
