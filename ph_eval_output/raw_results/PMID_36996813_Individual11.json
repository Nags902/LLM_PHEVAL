      "disease_name": "Neurodevelopmental disorder with intracranial hemorrhage, seizures, and spasticity",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:617778",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The phenotypic features of dilated third ventricle, lateral ventricle dilatation, cerebral hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and cerebral calcification closely match those observed in previously documented cases, suggesting a strong correlation with this disorder."

      "disease_name": "Kosaki overgrowth syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:616592",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Kosaki overgrowth syndrome can present with hydrocephalus, ventriculomegaly (lateral ventricle dilation), and cerebral calcifications, making it a possibility although less common than the primary diagnosis. This is another potential match based on overlapping phenotypes."

      "disease_name": "Cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:612199",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The presence of cerebral calcifications and dilated ventricles aligns with this condition known for microangiopathy and calcifications, offering another potential diagnosis although lacking some phenotypic features present in other possibilities."

    {
      "disease_name": "Intracranial hemorrhage, NEC",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308600",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "The symptom of cerebral hemorrhage is central to this diagnosis. The additional features of hydrocephalus and ventricle dilation further suggest this as a possibility, although the broader phenotypic pattern better fits more specific disorders."
