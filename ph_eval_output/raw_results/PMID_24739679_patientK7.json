      "disease_name": "Kabuki Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:147920",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This is the most likely diagnosis. Kabuki Syndrome is highly consistent with the presented phenotype, particularly the distinctive combination of 'Long palpebral fissure' and 'Eversion of lateral third of lower eyelids', which are hallmark features. Other strong matches include 'Global developmental delay', 'Hypotonia', 'Prominent fingertip pads', 'Finger clinodactyly', 'Wide nasal bridge', 'Macrotia', 'Hearing impairment', and 'Recurrent infections'. While Aortic valve stenosis is less common than other cardiac defects in Kabuki Syndrome, cardiac anomalies are frequent, and aortic stenosis has been reported."

      "disease_name": "Kabuki Syndrome 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300867",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Kabuki Syndrome 2, caused by mutations in KDM6A, presents with a phenotype that is nearly indistinguishable from Kabuki Syndrome 1 (KMT2D-related). It shares all the key phenotypic features, including the characteristic facial dysmorphism, developmental delay, hypotonia, cardiac anomalies, and immune dysfunction, making it an equally strong diagnostic consideration."

      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome 8",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:616559",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome is a strong differential diagnosis due to significant phenotypic overlap. Patients often present with 'Global developmental delay', 'Hypotonia', 'Hearing impairment', 'Recurrent infections', 'Wide nasal bridge', 'Macrotia', 'Prominent fingertip pads', and 'Finger clinodactyly'. While pulmonary valve stenosis is the classic cardiac defect, 'Aortic valve stenosis' can occur. Noonan Syndrome 8, caused by RIT1 mutations, has been associated with a broader spectrum of cardiac anomalies and lymphatic issues, making it a relevant subtype to consider given the specific cardiac finding. The 'Eversion of lateral third of lower eyelids' is less typical for Noonan Syndrome but some variability exists."

      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome 1, caused by PTPN11 mutations, is the most common form of Noonan Syndrome and shares many features with the patient, including 'Global developmental delay', 'Hypotonia', 'Hearing impairment', 'Recurrent infections', 'Wide nasal bridge', 'Prominent fingertip pads', 'Finger clinodactyly', and cardiac defects (though 'Aortic valve stenosis' is less common than pulmonary stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). The specific eyelid eversion feature is less characteristic of classical Noonan Syndrome."

    {
      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome 11",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:618036",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome 11, caused by LZTR1 mutations (often autosomal recessive), is also considered. It shares the core features of the Noonan spectrum, including 'Global developmental delay', 'Hypotonia', and cardiac anomalies (including 'Aortic valve stenosis' in some cases). This subtype is specifically noted to have a higher prevalence of hearing impairment, which aligns with the patient's phenotype. As with other Noonan subtypes, the specific eyelid eversion is less typical."
