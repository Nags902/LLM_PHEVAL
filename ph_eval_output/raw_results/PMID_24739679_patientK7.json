      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome is a common RASopathy characterized by facial dysmorphism (wide nasal bridge, long palpebral fissures, eversion of lateral third of lower eyelids), congenital heart defects (aortic valve stenosis), developmental delay, hypotonia, and hearing impairment. The patient's features align closely with this syndrome."

      "disease_name": "Kabuki Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:147920",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Kabuki Syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial features (long palpebral fissures, eversion of lateral third of lower eyelids, wide nasal bridge), developmental delay, hypotonia, and recurrent infections. The patient's features are consistent with this syndrome, though aortic valve stenosis is less common."

    {
      "disease_name": "CHARGE Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:214800",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "CHARGE Syndrome includes hearing impairment, developmental delay, and congenital heart defects (aortic valve stenosis). However, the patient lacks other key features like coloboma or choanal atresia, making this less likely."

      "disease_name": "Williams Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:194050",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Williams Syndrome is associated with aortic valve stenosis, developmental delay, and hypotonia. However, the facial features and hearing impairment in this patient are less typical for Williams Syndrome."

      "disease_name": "Cornelia de Lange Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:122470",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Cornelia de Lange Syndrome can present with developmental delay, hearing impairment, and distinctive facial features. However, the patient's features like macrotia and prominent fingertip pads are less characteristic of this syndrome."
