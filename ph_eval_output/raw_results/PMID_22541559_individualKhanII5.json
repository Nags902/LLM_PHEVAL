      "disease_name": "Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300322",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This X-linked disorder (fitting potential male gender) is characterized by severe intellectual disability and a distinctive motor dysfunction that includes spasticity (hypertonia), dystonia, and choreoathetosis. The age of 6 years is consistent with the presentation of these neurological features."

      "disease_name": "Spastic Paraplegia, Type 2, X-Linked",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308840",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This is an X-linked recessive disorder (fitting potential male gender) characterized by spasticity (hypertonia), particularly in the lower limbs, and intellectual disability is a frequently associated feature. The age of presentation is consistent with a childhood onset."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:225750",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome is an early-onset inflammatory encephalopathy characterized by progressive microcephaly, developmental delay/intellectual disability, and spasticity (hypertonia). The phenotypic features of intellectual disability and hypertonia are central to this diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300203",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This X-linked disorder, while often characterized by severe early-onset epilepsy, also commonly presents with severe global developmental delay/intellectual disability and a range of motor issues including hypertonia and spasticity. It affects both females and males."

      "disease_name": "GM2 Gangliosidosis, Type II (Sandhoff Disease)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:268800",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Sandhoff disease is a lysosomal storage disorder with various forms. The infantile and juvenile forms can present with progressive neurological deterioration, intellectual disability, and evolving tone abnormalities including hypertonia/spasticity, making it a plausible candidate at age 6."
