      "disease_id": "OMIM:220200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Presents with ventriculomegaly as a primary feature, along with developmental delays in motor and speech domains. The age of presentation and combination of CNS malformation with developmental delays is highly consistent."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:307000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Features ventriculomegaly/hydrocephalus as a cardinal sign with associated developmental delays. The patient's gender (assuming 2 = male) makes this X-linked condition possible."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:117550",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Characterized by developmental delays in motor and speech domains, and can present with ventriculomegaly. Astigmatism and other ocular abnormalities are also reported."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:602501",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Features ventriculomegaly, developmental delays, and can include ocular abnormalities. The presentation in early childhood is consistent with this diagnosis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:203450",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with ventriculomegaly and progressive developmental delays. The infantile form typically manifests before age 2, consistent with patient's age."

      "disease_name": "Fragile X Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300624",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Common cause of developmental delays in speech and motor domains. While ventriculomegaly is less common, mild ventricular enlargement can occur. Ocular abnormalities including refractive errors are reported."

      "disease_name": "Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (Hunter Syndrome)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:309900",
      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "Can present with developmental delays, mild ventriculomegaly, and ocular abnormalities. The age of presentation is consistent with the attenuated form."

      "explanation": "Features developmental delays and can have associated ventriculomegaly. Ocular abnormalities including refractive errors are common. The molar tooth sign would need to be evaluated on imaging."
