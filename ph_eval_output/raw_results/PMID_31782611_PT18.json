      "disease_id": "OMIM:616454",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features, including delayed speech and language development, delayed gross motor development, and astigmatism, closely match those seen in White-Sutton syndrome. Similar reference cases also support this diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Developmental delay with or without epilepsy",
      "disease_id": "None",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits delayed gross motor development and delayed speech and language development, which are common in this condition. However, the absence of seizures and other neurological symptoms lowers its rank compared to White-Sutton syndrome."

      "disease_name": "1p36 deletion syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607872",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This syndrome can present with delayed development and ventriculomegaly, but the lack of other typical features such as hypotonia or seizures makes it less likely."

    {
      "disease_name": "Rett syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312750",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "While Rett syndrome can present with delayed speech and motor development, the absence of regression and other hallmark features reduces its likelihood."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:235730",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This syndrome includes delayed development and ventriculomegaly, but the lack of distinctive facial features and Hirschsprung disease makes it less probable."
