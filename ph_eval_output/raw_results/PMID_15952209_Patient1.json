      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features such as brachydactyly, mesomelia, broad thumb, symphalangism, frontal bossing, short stature, and joint hypermobility closely match those seen in Robinow syndrome, autosomal recessive, as evidenced by the similar reference cases."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:617694",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Some features like short stature, long philtrum, hypertelorism, and joint hypermobility overlap with Al Kaissi syndrome, though the match is not as strong as with Robinow syndrome."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:180700",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The autosomal dominant form of Robinow syndrome shares many features with the recessive form, but the patient's presentation is more consistent with the recessive form based on the reference cases."

      "explanation": "Acromicric dysplasia includes brachydactyly and short stature, but lacks many of the other features seen in this patient, making it a less likely diagnosis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:231050",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Geleophysic dysplasia includes short stature and brachydactyly, but other key features such as mesomelia and symphalangism are not typically associated with this condition."
