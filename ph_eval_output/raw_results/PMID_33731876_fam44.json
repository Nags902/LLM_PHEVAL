      "disease_name": "CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300672",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This disorder is a strong candidate due to the classic combination of severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, including intractable infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia, alongside severe intellectual disability, spasticity, and other varied seizure types. Brain atrophy and CNS hypomyelination are frequently reported imaging findings, although not always the primary defining feature. While not universal, precocious puberty and short stature are recognized endocrine and growth complications in some individuals with severe neurodevelopmental disorders, including CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder."

      "disease_name": "Hypomyelination with Atrophy of the Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum (TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:612800",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This disorder directly aligns with several core imaging and motor features presented: CNS hypomyelination, brain atrophy, cerebellar atrophy, spasticity, hemiparesis, and severe intellectual disability. Seizures are common in H-ABC, making the seizure features plausible, though infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia might be less consistently emphasized as primary features compared to other epileptic encephalopathies. The presence of precocious puberty and short stature is less typical for this condition."

      "disease_name": "Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome (POLG-related mitochondrial disorder)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:203700",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome, a severe progressive mitochondrial encephalopathy caused by POLG mutations, can present with intractable and multifocal seizures (including various types such as focal and generalized tonic-clonic), developmental regression leading to severe intellectual disability, brain atrophy, and often hypomyelination. Short stature can be a feature of mitochondrial disease due to systemic involvement, making it a plausible fit. Precocious puberty is less commonly reported but endocrine dysfunction can occur in severe mitochondrial disorders."

      "disease_name": "Vanishing White Matter Disease (EIF2B-related leukoencephalopathy)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:603896",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Vanishing White Matter Disease is a prominent leukodystrophy characterized by progressive neurological deterioration, significantly matching CNS hypomyelination, brain atrophy (specifically 'vanishing white matter'), cerebellar atrophy, spasticity, hemiparesis, and severe intellectual disability. Seizures are also a feature. However, the specific pattern of infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia is not typically the predominant seizure presentation, and precocious puberty is not a recognized feature of this condition."
