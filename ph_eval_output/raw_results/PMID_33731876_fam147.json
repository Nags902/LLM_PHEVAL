      "explanation": "This disease is also highly relevant as it was the diagnosis in one of the similar reference cases that presented with Focal-onset seizure. Although that case also included EEG findings not present in the patient's current data, the shared core feature of focal-onset seizure makes it a strong second candidate, guided by the reference cases."
