      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Presents with sensorineural hearing loss in ~20% of cases, which can lead to speech delays. Additional features like pigmentary abnormalities would help confirm."

      "explanation": "Higher frequency of hearing loss (~50%) compared to Type 1, leading to speech delays. Lacks dystopia canthorum seen in Type 1."
