      "disease_name": "Activated PI3K-delta Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:615513",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This syndrome directly causes a Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)-like phenotype that highly aligns with all presented features: recurrent sinopulmonary infections (sinusitis), hypogammaglobulinemia (low IgA and IgM), B lymphocytopenia, and especially the significant reduction in class-switched memory B cells. APDS is characterized by a specific constellation of immune dysregulation involving B cells."

      "disease_name": "LPS-Responsive And Beige-Like Anchor Protein Deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:614704",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "LRBA deficiency is a well-recognized cause of CVID-like disease. It is characterized by recurrent infections (e.g., sinusitis), hypogammaglobulinemia (low IgA and IgM are common), and profound B cell defects, including B lymphocytopenia and a significant decrease in class-switched memory B cells, making it a strong match for the patient's phenotype."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:616339",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Haploinsufficiency of NFKB1 (CVID13) is a frequent monogenic cause of CVID, presenting with hypogammaglobulinemia (often affecting IgA and IgM), recurrent sinopulmonary infections, impaired specific antibody responses, and various B cell defects, including reduced B cell numbers and impaired class-switched memory B cell formation, closely matching the patient's presentation."

    {
      "disease_name": "CTLA4 Haploinsufficiency with Autoimmune Infiltration",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:616360",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "CTLA4 haploinsufficiency presents as a primary immunodeficiency with features overlapping CVID, including recurrent infections, hypogammaglobulinemia (low IgA, IgG, and often IgM), impaired vaccine responses, and B cell dysfunction, specifically affecting class-switched memory B cells. These features are highly consistent with the patient's profile."

    {
      "disease_name": "Immunodeficiency, Common Variable, 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613470",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Mutations in TNFRSF13B (TACI), which cause CVID type 1, are a common genetic cause and susceptibility factor for CVID. This deficiency leads to hypogammaglobulinemia (often including low IgA and IgM), impaired specific antibody responses, and contributes to the B cell defects observed, including issues with class switching."

      "disease_name": "Agammaglobulinemia, X-linked",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300755",
      "score": 0.16666666666666666,
      "explanation": "X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) results in a profound deficiency or absence of B cells and all immunoglobulin classes (IgA, IgM, IgG), leading to severe recurrent infections like sinusitis. While the B lymphocytopenia and low IgA/IgM fit, the description 'decreased proportion of class-switched memory B cells' is less characteristic for XLA, which typically has near-absent peripheral B cells rather than a defect in a subset of present B cells. However, given the patient's gender and severity, it remains an important differential."
