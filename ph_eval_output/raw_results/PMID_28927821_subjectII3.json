      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) is characterized by decreased levels of IgA and IgM, recurrent infections like sinusitis, and decreased specific antibody response to vaccines. The patient's features closely match those seen in CVID."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:308230",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Hyper IgM Syndrome Type 1 is an immunodeficiency disorder with features such as decreased class-switched memory B cells and low circulating IgA. The recurrent infections and B cell abnormalities align with this condition."

      "disease_name": "X-linked Agammaglobulinemia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300755",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "This condition results in significantly reduced levels of all immunoglobulin classes and recurrent bacterial infections. While IgM and IgA are specifically decreased, the combination of features is somewhat consistent with this disease, although B lymphocytopenia is more prominent."
