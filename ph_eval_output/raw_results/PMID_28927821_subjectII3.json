      "disease_id": "OMIM:616873",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features closely match those of the reference cases, including B lymphocytopenia, decreased class-switched memory B cells, decreased IgA and IgM, recurrent sinusitis, and poor response to polysaccharide vaccines, all of which are hallmark signs of this immunodeficiency."

      "disease_name": "Agammaglobulinemia, X-linked",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300755",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition involves low levels of all immunoglobulin types and recurrent infections, similar to the patient's symptoms, though the lack of specific mention of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) mutation or family history makes it less likely than CVID13."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Hyper-IgM syndrome type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308230",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Characterized by decreased IgA and IgG with normal or elevated IgM, which partially aligns with the patient's lab results, but the decreased IgM in this patient makes this diagnosis less likely."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Selective IgA deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:137100",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "The patient's decreased IgA is a key feature, but the additional deficiencies in IgM and B cell abnormalities suggest a broader immunodeficiency than selective IgA deficiency alone."
