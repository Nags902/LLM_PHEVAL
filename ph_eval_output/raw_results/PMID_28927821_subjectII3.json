      "disease_id": "OMIM:615158",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms like B lymphocytopenia, decreased circulating IgA and IgM concentrations, recurrent sinusitis, and poor antibody response to vaccines strongly align with the phenotypic features observed in similar cases diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency."

      "disease_name": "Immunodeficiency, common variable, 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:604260",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While similar to common variable immunodeficiency type 13, this variant also presents with overlapping immunologic features and recurrent infections, although specific phenotypes may vary slightly."

    {
      "disease_name": "Hyper-IgM Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:304150",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Given the decreased specific antibody responses and immunoglobulin deficiencies, Hyper-IgM Syndrome remains a possibility, especially considering its association with defects in antibody class-switching."

      "disease_name": "Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:600000",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This rare condition leads to severe immunodeficiency and can show similar laboratory findings, although it typically has broader clinical manifestations and should be considered due to recurrent infections."
