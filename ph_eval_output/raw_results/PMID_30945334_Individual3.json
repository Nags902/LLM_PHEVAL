      "disease_name": "Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, Type Ia (PMM2-CDG)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:212065",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This patient's comprehensive presentation of global developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, seizures, cerebral atrophy, thin corpus callosum, spastic diplegia, and characteristic facial features (prominent nasal bridge, thin upper lip vermilion) strongly aligns with Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG), especially Type Ia (PMM2-CDG). Short stature is also a common feature. While obesity is less typical for PMM2-CDG (failure to thrive is more common), it has been reported in other CDG types or could be a secondary manifestation given the patient's age and neurological impairment, making it the most plausible fit across the broad range of symptoms."

      "disease_name": "Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome 1 (TREX1-Related)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:225750",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome (AGS) is a strong candidate due to its characteristic severe neurological phenotype, including global developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, spastic diplegia, cerebral atrophy, and thin corpus callosum. Short stature can also be present. However, the specific facial features (prominent nasal bridge, thin upper lip vermilion) are not hallmark features of AGS, and obesity is not typically associated with the syndrome, making it a less comprehensive fit than CDG for the full phenotypic spectrum."

      "disease_name": "Cerebro-Oculo-Facio-Skeletal Syndrome 1 (COFS1)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:214150",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "COFS syndrome presents with a severe neurodegenerative course marked by global developmental delay, intellectual disability, profound cerebral atrophy, spasticity, seizures, and frequently, thin corpus callosum. The distinctive facial features (prominent nasal bridge, thin upper lip vermilion) and short stature are also highly characteristic. The primary discrepancy is the presence of obesity, as patients with COFS syndrome typically experience cachexia or failure to thrive. Despite this significant mismatch in weight, the strong alignment of numerous other severe and specific features makes it a potential diagnosis."

    {
      "disease_name": "Prader-Willi Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:176270",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Prader-Willi Syndrome fits the patient's intellectual disability, global developmental delay, obesity, short stature, and some overlapping facial features like a thin upper lip vermilion. However, the severe brain pathology, specifically cerebral atrophy, thin corpus callosum, and spastic diplegia, are not primary or typical features of Prader-Willi Syndrome. While seizures can occur, the overall neurological severity and specific structural abnormalities do not align well with the classic presentation of this syndrome, placing it lower on the differential."
