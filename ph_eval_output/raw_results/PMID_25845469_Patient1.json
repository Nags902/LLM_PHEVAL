      "disease_id": "OMIM:615896",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This condition matches several phenotypic features such as global developmental delay, profound intellectual disability, nonprogressive encephalopathy, EEG abnormality, dystonia, spasticity, hypoplasia of the pons, absent speech, and axial hypotonia. The similarity to Case 1 strongly supports this diagnosis."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition includes features like intellectual disability, hypoplasia of the pons, absent speech, dystonia, and hypotonia, which are present in the patient. Similar reference cases (Case 2 and Case 3) provide a basis for this ranking."
