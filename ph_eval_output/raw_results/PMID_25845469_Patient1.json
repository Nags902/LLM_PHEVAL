      "disease_name": "CHARGE Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:214800",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This syndrome aligns remarkably well with the patient's diverse symptoms, including profound intellectual disability, global developmental delay, nonprogressive encephalopathy, movement disorders (dystonia, spasticity, hypotonia), absent speech, EEG abnormality, ventricular septal defect, and crucially, hypoplasia of the pons, all of which are common features in CHARGE syndrome."

    {
      "disease_name": "Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia, Type 7",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:612958",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This specific subtype of pontocerebellar hypoplasia is a strong candidate due to the explicit mention of 'hypoplasia of the pons.' It also frequently presents with profound developmental delay, movement disorders (spasticity), seizures (EEG abnormality), and importantly, congenital heart defects like ventricular septal defect, directly matching key patient features."

    {
      "disease_name": "Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia, Type 14",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:616268",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "PCH14 is another specific type of pontocerebellar hypoplasia that fits the core brain imaging finding. It is characterized by severe global developmental delay, intellectual disability, movement disorders (spasticity), and often includes systemic features such as cardiac involvement (e.g., VSD), making it a relevant consideration."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia, Type 2A",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:605809",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "As the most common form of pontocerebellar hypoplasia, PCH2A perfectly explains the 'hypoplasia of the pons,' profound intellectual disability, global developmental delay, absent speech, and movement disorders (dystonia, spasticity). While VSD is less typical, it can occur in severe cases, making it a strong fit for the primary neurological and developmental features."

    {
      "disease_name": "Joubert Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:213300",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Joubert Syndrome and related disorders are characterized by midbrain-hindbrain malformations (including pontine hypoplasia as part of the 'molar tooth sign'), which aligns with the patient's brain imaging. The syndrome also commonly presents with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, absent speech, and EEG abnormalities, with cardiac defects being a possible associated feature."
