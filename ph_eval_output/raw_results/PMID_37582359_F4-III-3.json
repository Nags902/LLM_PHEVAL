      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with nearly all the key features seen in the reference cases diagnosed with craniometadiaphyseal osteosclerosis, including increased bone density, thickened calvaria, sandwich vertebrae, thickened cortex of long bones, coarse metaphyseal trabecularization, hypertelorism, depressed nasal bridge, hip dysplasia, and global developmental delay."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:265900",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Shares several skeletal features including flared metaphyses, increased bone density, and coarse trabeculation. However, Pyle disease typically lacks the severe craniofacial involvement and sandwich vertebrae seen in this patient."

      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Shares craniofacial features (hypertelorism, depressed nasal bridge) and metaphyseal abnormalities, but typically shows metaphyseal widening rather than the specific pattern of increased density and trabeculation seen here."
