      "disease_id": "OMIM:269300",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The clinical features, including global developmental delay, hip dysplasia, sandwich appearance of vertebral bodies, and increased bone mineral density, closely match with Craniometadiaphyseal Dysplasia, as supported by similar reference cases."

      "disease_name": "Osteogenesis Imperfecta, Type XI",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:610968",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Presence of bone abnormalities such as thickened cortex of long bones and increased bone mineral density, coupled with developmental issues, suggests a possible link to Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type XI."

      "disease_name": "Frontometaphyseal Dysplasia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:305620",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Features like hypertelorism, hip dysplasia, thickened calvaria, and metaphyseal abnormalities are associated with Frontometaphyseal Dysplasia, although it is less common compared to Craniometadiaphyseal Dysplasia."

      "disease_name": "Sclerosteosis",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:269500",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Increased bone density and thickening, particularly of the calvaria and long bones, align with Sclerosteosis, though lacking some distinguishing features typically required for a definitive diagnosis."
