      "disease_id": "OMIM:147920",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Kabuki Syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, and developmental delay. Features such as low-set ears, thin upper lip vermilion, microtia, seizure, and hypotonia align with this condition. Sparse scalp hair and hypertrichosis can variably be present."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:300867",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similar to Kabuki Syndrome 1, Kabuki Syndrome 2 shares overlapping features, including intellectual disability, hypotonia, and distinctive facial characteristics. Mutations in different genes cause similar phenotypic outcomes."
