      "explanation": "The patient exhibits multiple hallmark features of Neurofibromatosis type 1, including plexiform neurofibroma, axillary and inguinal freckling, multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and Lisch nodules, which are consistent with the reference cases provided."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome shares some features with Neurofibromatosis type 1, such as cafe-au-lait spots and freckling, but typically lacks the neurofibromas and Lisch nodules seen in this patient."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:601321",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This syndrome combines features of Neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome, but the absence of Noonan-specific features (e.g., short stature, heart defects) makes it less likely."
