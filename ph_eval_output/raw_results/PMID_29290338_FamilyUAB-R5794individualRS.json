      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Patient presents with all classic diagnostic criteria for NF1: multiple cafe-au-lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules, and plexiform neurofibroma. This matches perfectly with all three reference cases."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:162260",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "A rare variant of neurofibromatosis that can present with cafe-au-lait spots and neurofibromas, but typically has fewer cutaneous manifestations and no Lisch nodules, making it less likely than NF1."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "An allelic variant of NF1 that presents with cafe-au-lait spots and axillary freckling, but typically includes pulmonary stenosis and short stature, which are not reported in this patient."

      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Presents with cafe-au-lait spots and freckling similar to NF1, but lacks neurofibromas and Lisch nodules, making it inconsistent with this patient's presentation."

      "disease_name": "McCune-Albright syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with cafe-au-lait spots, but these typically have irregular borders and are associated with fibrous dysplasia and endocrine abnormalities, not the NF1-specific features seen here."
