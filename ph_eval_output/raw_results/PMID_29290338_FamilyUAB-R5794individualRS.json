      "explanation": "All five phenotypic features are pathognomonic for NF1: cafe-au-lait spots, axillary/inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules, and plexiform neurofibroma are classic diagnostic criteria."

      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Shows cafe-au-lait spots and freckling similar to NF1, but specifically lacks neurofibromas and Lisch nodules, making it unlikely given the patient's presentation."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with cafe-au-lait spots but they are typically large, irregular, and unilateral; lacks other NF1 features like freckling, Lisch nodules, and neurofibromas."
