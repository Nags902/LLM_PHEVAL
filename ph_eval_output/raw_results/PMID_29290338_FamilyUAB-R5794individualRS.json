      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome shares some features with Neurofibromatosis type 1, such as cafe-au-lait spots and axillary freckling, but typically lacks plexiform neurofibromas and Lisch nodules, making it a less likely diagnosis."

      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This rare syndrome combines features of Neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome, but the absence of Noonan syndrome features in the patient makes this diagnosis less likely."
