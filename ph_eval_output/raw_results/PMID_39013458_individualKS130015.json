      "disease_name": "Smith-Magenis Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:182290",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This syndrome aligns remarkably well with all presented features, including intellectual disability, global developmental delay, hypotonia, chronic constipation, and a high prevalence of overweight/obesity. Self-mutilation and other self-injurious behaviors are characteristic features of SMS."

    {
      "disease_name": "Prader-Willi Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:176270",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Prader-Willi syndrome is a strong candidate due to its classic features of infantile hypotonia, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, hyperphagia leading to overweight/obesity in childhood, and chronic constipation. Self-injurious behaviors, particularly skin-picking, are also commonly observed in PWS."

    {
      "disease_name": "Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300322",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "While Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome is famously characterized by severe self-mutilation (lip and finger biting), intellectual disability, global developmental delay, and early hypotonia, the feature of 'Overweight' is a significant mismatch, as patients are typically lean due to feeding difficulties or movement disorders. Chronic constipation is not a primary feature."

    {
      "disease_name": "Angelman Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:105830",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Angelman syndrome presents with severe intellectual disability, global developmental delay, hypotonia, and chronic constipation. Self-injurious behaviors, such as hand-biting, can occur. However, patients with Angelman syndrome are typically lean and do not exhibit the 'Overweight' phenotype."
