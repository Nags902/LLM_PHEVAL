      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Perfect match with reference cases. Patient shares all major features including epileptic encephalopathy, epileptic spasms, abnormal electroretinogram, cerebral atrophy, spasticity, hypokinesia, global developmental delay, hyperreflexia, rigidity, axial hypotonia, EEG abnormality, reduced eye contact, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Shares epileptic encephalopathy, seizures, cerebral atrophy, developmental regression, spasticity, and abnormal electroretinogram. However, lacks typical cherry-red spot and storage material findings."

      "explanation": "Features overlap including cerebral atrophy, spasticity, rigidity, hyperreflexia, developmental regression, and axial hypotonia. Abnormal electroretinogram can occur, but epileptic spasms are less typical."

      "explanation": "Can present with epileptic encephalopathy, developmental delay, spasticity, and cerebral atrophy. However, abnormal electroretinogram is not a typical feature, and metabolic acidosis is usually present."
