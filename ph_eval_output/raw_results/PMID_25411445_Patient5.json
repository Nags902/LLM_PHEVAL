      "explanation": "The phenotypic features presented closely match those observed in previous cases diagnosed with Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 28, indicating a strong likelihood."

      "disease_name": "Aicardi Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:304050",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Features such as increased nuchal translucency, seizures, and cerebral abnormalities align with Aicardi syndrome, although not all clinical data perfectly match."

      "disease_name": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:605284",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "The presence of seizures, global developmental delay, and signs of cerebral atrophy could suggest Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, albeit less likely than Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 28."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:613720",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "The combination of epilepsy and developmental delay may suggest a KCNQ2-related disorder, though specifics such as nuchal translucency are not directly linked."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Cerebral atrophy and developmental delay are common features of Pachygyria, but it is a less specific fit compared to the primary candidates listed."
