      "disease_id": "OMIM:616981",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The provided symptoms closely match the phenotypic features of Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 28, including increased nuchal translucency, cerebral atrophy, epileptic spasms, and multiple other neurological features. Additionally, reference cases with similar features were diagnosed with this condition."

      "disease_name": "West Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The presence of epileptic spasms, global developmental delay, and EEG abnormalities suggests West Syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy in infants often presenting with similar features. Although the fit is less perfect than Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 28, it remains a plausible differential diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome 1 can present with increased nuchal translucency and developmental delay. While the neurological symptoms are less specific to this condition, it remains a candidate due to its genetic variability and overlapping features."
