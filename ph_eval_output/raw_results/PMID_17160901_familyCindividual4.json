      "disease_name": "Xeroderma Pigmentosum, Complementation Group A",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:278700",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is strongly associated with freckling, particularly on sun-exposed areas. It is a significant consideration for rare pediatric cases presenting with freckling due to its link to DNA repair defects."

      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis, Type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Freckling is a characteristic feature of Neurofibromatosis Type 1, often appearing in unusual locations such as axillary or inguinal regions. This genetic disorder is relatively common among syndromes presenting with freckling."

      "disease_name": "LEOPARD Syndrome 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613707",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "LEOPARD syndrome is a rare genetic condition encompassing multiple systemic manifestations including freckling. This disorder is due to mutations affecting the RAS/MAPK pathway."

      "disease_name": "Bloom Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:210900",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Bloom Syndrome patients can exhibit skin lesions like freckling, often along with photosensitivity. It is caused by mutations in the BLM gene, leading to increased chromosomal breakage."

      "disease_name": "Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:175200",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome is characterized by melanotic macules, similar to freckles, around the mouth and digits. It is an autosomal dominant condition requiring consideration if perioral pigmentation is present."
