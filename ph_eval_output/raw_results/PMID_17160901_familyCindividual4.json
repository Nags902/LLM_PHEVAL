      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis, type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This is the most likely diagnosis due to the strong guidance from the similar reference cases. All reference cases, which include 'Freckling' or its specific forms (axillary/inguinal freckling) as a key phenotypic feature, were diagnosed as Neurofibromatosis, type 1. Freckling (especially axillary and inguinal) is a major diagnostic criterion for NF1, and even generalized freckling can be an early or less specific manifestation pointing towards it in the context of reference cases."

      "disease_name": "LEOPARD Syndrome (PTPN11-related)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "LEOPARD syndrome, a variant of Noonan syndrome, is characterized by multiple lentigines, which are small pigmented spots similar to freckles. It is a plausible differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with freckling, and shares some overlapping features with NF1 as both are RASopathies."

      "disease_name": "LEOPARD Syndrome (RAF1-related)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611558",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Another genetic subtype of LEOPARD syndrome, also characterized by lentigines (akin to freckles). This specific genetic cause is considered as a potential differential, following the PTPN11-related type due to its association with similar dermatological manifestations."

      "disease_name": "LEOPARD Syndrome (BRAF-related)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:605275",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This is the third recognized genetic subtype of LEOPARD syndrome, which presents with multiple lentigines resembling freckles. It should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis for cutaneous pigmentation alongside other LEOPARD syndrome subtypes."

      "disease_name": "Carney Complex",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:160980",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Carney Complex is an inherited disorder that features pigmented lesions, including lentigines (similar to freckles), particularly on the face, lips, eyelids, and oral mucosa. While other features are needed for a definitive diagnosis, the presence of freckling makes it a possible, though less probable, differential."

      "disease_name": "Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:175200",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome is characterized by distinctive mucocutaneous lentigines, which are a form of freckling, typically found around the mouth, nostrils, eyes, and on the buccal mucosa and digits. Although the patient's freckling is broadly described, this condition is a recognized cause of pigmentary changes that could be described as freckling."
