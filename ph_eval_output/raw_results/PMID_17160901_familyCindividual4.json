      "explanation": "Freckling (especially axillary/inguinal) is a major diagnostic criterion for NF1. All reference cases with freckling were diagnosed with NF1. Although the patient lacks reported caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, freckling alone in a 17-year-old strongly suggests NF1."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Also known as NF1-like syndrome, presents with caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and freckling but without neurofibromas. Could explain isolated freckling, though typically includes caf\u00e9-au-lait spots."

      "explanation": "Presents with caf\u00e9-au-lait spots that can be mistaken for freckling. However, the spots are typically larger with irregular borders and usually accompanied by fibrous dysplasia."
