      "disease_id": "OMIM:231670",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features, including elevated urine 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaric aciduria, macrocephaly, developmental regression, subdural hemorrhage, elevated glutarylcarnitine, and cerebral atrophy, closely match the phenotypic presentations in reference cases diagnosed with Glutaricaciduria type I."

      "disease_name": "L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:236792",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Some overlap in symptoms such as developmental regression and macrocephaly; however, the absence of more common L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria features like cerebellar ataxia suggests this is less likely than Glutaricaciduria type I."

      "disease_name": "Canavan disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:271900",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "Shares phenotypic features such as cerebral atrophy and macrocephaly with the patient's presentation, but lacks key biomarkers and metabolic profiles such as elevated 3-hydroxyglutaric acid typical of Glutaricaciduria type I."
