      "explanation": "Perfect match with all key features: elevated 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaric aciduria, elevated glutarylcarnitine, macrocephaly, subdural hemorrhage, cerebral atrophy, and developmental regression. All three reference cases with identical diagnoses share these same features."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Can present with glutaric aciduria and developmental issues, but typically has multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency with different metabolic profile, hypoglycemia, and metabolic acidosis not mentioned in this case."

      "explanation": "Rare variant with glutaric aciduria but usually without neurological symptoms. The presence of cerebral atrophy, macrocephaly, and developmental regression makes this less likely than type I."
