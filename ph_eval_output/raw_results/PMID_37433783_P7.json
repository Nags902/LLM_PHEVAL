      "disease_name": "Pitt-Hopkins syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:610954",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features such as intellectual disability, autism, delayed speech and language development, and midface retrusion are highly consistent with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome. The presence of thick eyebrows and prominent fingertip pads further supports this diagnosis."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Coffin-Siris syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:135900",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient's hypoplastic nasal bridge, intellectual disability, and delayed motor development are seen in Coffin-Siris syndrome. However, the absence of hypertrichosis and sparse scalp hair makes this less likely than Pitt-Hopkins syndrome."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Smith-Magenis syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:182290",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Intellectual disability, delayed speech, and autistic behaviors are common in Smith-Magenis syndrome, but the lack of behavioral sleep disturbances and brachydactyly reduces the likelihood."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Noonan syndrome can present with intellectual disability and delayed development, but the absence of cardiac anomalies and typical facial features (e.g., webbed neck) makes this less likely."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Rett syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312750",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Although Rett syndrome includes features like intellectual disability and delayed development, it is less likely due to the absence of regression and hand stereotypies, and it is more common in females."
