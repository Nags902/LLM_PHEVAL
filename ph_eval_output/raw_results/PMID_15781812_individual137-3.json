      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Classic presentation with myoclonic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, progressive neurologic deterioration, myoclonus, and gait disturbance. Early-onset dementia fits the progressive cognitive decline seen in this condition."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:254780",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Features myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizures with rapid cognitive decline and dementia. The absence seizures are less typical but can occur. Usually more rapid progression than observed."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Presents with myoclonic seizures, absence seizures, and tonic-clonic seizures. However, progressive deterioration and dementia are not typical features, making this less likely."

      "explanation": "Progressive neurodegenerative disorder with seizures (including myoclonic), cognitive decline, and motor deterioration. The seizure types match well, though visual symptoms are usually prominent."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Mitochondrial disorder featuring myoclonus, seizures, progressive neurologic deterioration, and ataxia. Dementia can occur but is less prominent. Additional features like hearing loss are typically present."

      "explanation": "Features myoclonus, seizures, and progressive neurologic deterioration. Gait ataxia is common. However, cherry-red spots and visual symptoms are usually prominent features not mentioned here."
