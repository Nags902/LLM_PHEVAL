      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Though not as precise a match as Lafora Disease, symptoms such as myoclonus, myoclonic seizures, and gait disturbances are also seen in Unverricht-Lundborg disease, which is a form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:612437",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The combination of seizures (myoclonic, absence, tonic-clonic), myoclonus, and progressive neurological decline aligns with Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy types. However, other common features like cerebellar ataxia are not listed, making it less likely than Lafora Disease."
