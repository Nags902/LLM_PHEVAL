      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Matches rod-cone dystrophy with skeletal anomalies (brachydactyly, short stature), intellectual disability, and developmental delays. The reference cases diagnosed as 'Retinitis pigmentosa with or without skeletal anomalies' strongly suggest this ciliopathy syndrome."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:606996",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Another form of Senior-Loken syndrome that presents with similar features including rod-cone dystrophy, skeletal anomalies, and developmental issues. Different genetic cause but similar phenotype."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Ciliopathy with rod-cone dystrophy, brachydactyly, intellectual disability, and developmental delays. However, lacks obesity which is typically present in BBS."

      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Features rod-cone dystrophy, intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism (micrognathia, frontal bossing), and short stature. Matches many features but typically has more severe intellectual disability."

      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Ciliopathy that can present with intellectual disability, developmental delays, and sometimes retinal dystrophy. The Chiari malformation could represent cerebellar involvement."

      "explanation": "Retinitis pigmentosa, hypopituitarism, nephronophthisis, and skeletal dysplasia syndrome. Matches retinal dystrophy and skeletal features but lacks clear evidence of renal involvement."
