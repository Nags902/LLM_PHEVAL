      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is the most likely diagnosis given the presence of plexiform neurofibromas, spinal neurofibromas, multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and scoliosis, which are hallmark features of this condition."

      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:101000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Neurofibromatosis type 2 is less likely but still possible, as it can present with neurofibromas and cafe-au-lait spots, though it is more commonly associated with bilateral vestibular schwannomas."

    {
      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome can present with cafe-au-lait spots and scoliosis, but it typically lacks the neurofibromas seen in this patient, making it a less likely diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines can present with cafe-au-lait-like spots and scoliosis, but neurofibromas are not a typical feature, making this diagnosis unlikely."

      "disease_name": "McCune-Albright syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.2,
