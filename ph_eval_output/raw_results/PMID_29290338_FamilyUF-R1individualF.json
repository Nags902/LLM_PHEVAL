      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Patient presents with classic NF1 features including multiple cafe-au-lait spots, plexiform neurofibroma, spinal neurofibroma, and scoliosis. All three reference cases with identical phenotypes were diagnosed with NF1."

      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis, type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:101000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "NF2 can present with spinal neurofibromas and cafe-au-lait spots, though typically fewer than in NF1. Plexiform neurofibromas are less common in NF2, making this diagnosis less likely."

    {
      "disease_name": "Segmental neurofibromatosis",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:162210",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "A localized form of NF1 that can present with cafe-au-lait spots and neurofibromas in a segmental distribution. However, the presence of both plexiform and spinal neurofibromas suggests more systemic involvement."

      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Also known as NF1-like syndrome, presents with multiple cafe-au-lait spots but typically lacks neurofibromas, making this diagnosis unlikely given the presence of both plexiform and spinal neurofibromas."

    {
      "disease_name": "Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:276300",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with cafe-au-lait spots similar to NF1, but neurofibromas are not typical features. The presence of multiple neurofibromas makes this diagnosis very unlikely."
