      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with multiple cafe-au-lait spots, plexiform neurofibroma, spinal neurofibroma, and scoliosis, which are hallmark features of Neurofibromatosis type 1. The similar reference cases also strongly support this diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome shares some features with Neurofibromatosis type 1, such as cafe-au-lait spots and freckling, but typically lacks neurofibromas. The presence of neurofibromas in this patient makes this diagnosis less likely."

      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis, type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:101000",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Neurofibromatosis type 2 is characterized by vestibular schwannomas and other nervous system tumors, but cafe-au-lait spots and cutaneous neurofibromas are less common. The patient's features are more consistent with type 1."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",

      "explanation": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines can present with cafe-au-lait spots and scoliosis, but neurofibromas are not a typical feature. The patient's neurofibromas make this diagnosis less likely."
