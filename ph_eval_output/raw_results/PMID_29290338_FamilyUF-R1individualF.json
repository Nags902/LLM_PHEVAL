      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "A variant form of neurofibromatosis that can present with similar features to NF1 including neurofibromas and cafe-au-lait spots, though less common."

      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Presents with multiple cafe-au-lait spots similar to NF1, but typically lacks neurofibromas. The presence of plexiform and spinal neurofibromas makes this less likely."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Can present with cafe-au-lait spots and skeletal abnormalities including scoliosis, but the spots typically have irregular borders and neurofibromas are not a feature."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:276300",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can rarely present with cafe-au-lait spots resembling NF1, but neurofibromas are uncommon and other features like early-onset malignancies would be expected."
