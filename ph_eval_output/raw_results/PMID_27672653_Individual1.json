      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This disease correlates closely with the provided clinical features, including elevated urine 3-hydroxyglutaric level, glutaric aciduria, inability to walk, dystonia, and macrocephaly, aligning with the symptoms presented in similar reference cases."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While it may not be as specific as glutaric aciduria type I, the presence of elevated 3-hydroxyglutaric levels and associated symptoms suggest the likelihood of an organic acidemia, which can share similar manifestations."
