      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (dysphagia, respiratory insufficiency, ophthalmoplegia, asthenia, and ptosis) closely match those of the reference cases diagnosed with Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy. This is the most likely diagnosis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:618640",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similar to Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy 1, this subtype also presents with the same symptoms. The reference cases were diagnosed with this subtype, making it a strong candidate."

      "disease_name": "Myasthenia gravis",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:254200",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Myasthenia gravis can present with ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and dysphagia. However, respiratory insufficiency is less common unless in severe cases, making it a less likely but possible diagnosis."

      "explanation": "Mitochondrial myopathies can cause ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and respiratory insufficiency. However, dysphagia is less commonly a primary feature, placing it lower in the ranking."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:601462",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This condition can present with similar symptoms but typically manifests earlier in life. The patient's age makes this less likely, but it is still a possible diagnosis."
