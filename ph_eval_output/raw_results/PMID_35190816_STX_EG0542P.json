      "explanation": "The phenotypic features of this patient, including infantile spasms, focal impaired awareness seizures, tonic seizures, generalized slow activity on EEG, relative macrocephaly, and global developmental delay, closely match the characteristics of Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 4, which was identified in similar reference cases 2 and 3."

      "disease_name": "West syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "West syndrome is a disorder characterized primarily by infantile spasms (also known as epileptic spasms), developmental delay, and specific EEG abnormality (hypsarrhythmia), observed in this patient. Although not identical, the patient's symptoms bear resemblance to those seen in cases diagnosed with different developmental epileptic encephalopathies."

      "disease_name": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The combination of early-onset epileptic seizures, including multiple seizure types, EEG abnormalities, and developmental delays, are consistent with a category of diseases termed developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, of which DEE1 is a variant."
