      "disease_id": "OMIM:612164",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Perfect match with Case 1 reference, sharing all key features: burst suppression EEG, infantile spasms, generalized tonic seizures, global developmental delay, and hypsarrhythmia. The phenotypic overlap is complete for the core features."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Strong match with Cases 2 and 3, sharing burst suppression EEG, epileptic encephalopathy, focal tonic seizures, generalized tonic seizures, infantile spasms, and severe intellectual disability. Only lacks abnormal brain morphology seen in reference cases."

      "disease_name": "Ohtahara syndrome (Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Classic features include burst suppression pattern, early-onset seizures including tonic spasms, and severe developmental impairment. The presence of multiple seizure types and progression to hypsarrhythmia is characteristic."

      "disease_name": "West syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Characterized by the triad of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and developmental regression/delay. However, burst suppression pattern is more typical of earlier-onset epileptic encephalopathies."

      "explanation": "KCNQ2-related encephalopathy can present with burst suppression, multiple seizure types including tonic seizures, and severe developmental impairment, though myoclonic seizures are less common."
