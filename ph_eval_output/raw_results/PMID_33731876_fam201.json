      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features closely match those of the reference cases 2 and 3, which were diagnosed as Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 11. The presence of EEG with burst suppression, epileptic encephalopathy, focal tonic seizure, generalized tonic seizure, hypsarrhythmia, infantile spasms, and severe intellectual disability strongly suggest this diagnosis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:612164",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient's features also overlap with reference case 1, which was diagnosed as Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 4. The presence of EEG with burst suppression, infantile spasms, generalized tonic seizure, global developmental delay, and hypsarrhythmia supports this diagnosis, though it is less comprehensive a match than Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 11."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "This condition is characterized by early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, hypsarrhythmia, and severe developmental delay, which are present in the patient. However, the match is less specific compared to the other two conditions."

      "disease_name": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300672",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This condition involves early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with burst suppression pattern on EEG, similar to the patient's presentation. However, other features like hypsarrhythmia and infantile spasms are less commonly associated."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This rare condition includes epileptic encephalopathy, intellectual disability, and developmental delay, but the specific EEG findings and seizure types in the patient are less typical for this diagnosis."
