      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This disease closely matches the patient's phenotypic features such as EEG burst suppression, various types of seizures, global developmental delay, and severe intellectual disability, aligning with the reference cases."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:300055",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While it shares several features with the patient's presentation, it is less comprehensive than Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 11 but still a relevant diagnosis given the EEG and seizure types."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "The presence of infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia aligns with West Syndrome, which is included in the spectrum of epileptic encephalopathies, warranting this diagnosis consideration."

      "explanation": "This syndrome presents with multiple seizure types and developmental delays, making it a potential consideration based on the combination of seizures exhibited by the patient."
