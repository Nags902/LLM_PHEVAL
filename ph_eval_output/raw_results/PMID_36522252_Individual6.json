      "disease_name": "Angelman Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:105830",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Angelman syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, absent speech, seizures, and motor delay, which align with the patient's phenotypic features. Although not all features exactly match, the profound intellectual disability and absent speech are highly suggestive."

      "disease_name": "Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:610042",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Pitt-Hopkins syndrome shares features such as intellectual disability, absent speech, and seizures with the patient. Tented upper lip and motor delay also fit, although some metabolic features like hypercholesterolemia are not typical."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Mowat-Wilson Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:235730",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "Mowat-Wilson syndrome includes intellectual disability, seizures, and motor delay, similar to the patient's presentation. The craniofacial features bear some resemblance as well, including high palate and hirsutism."

    {
      "disease_name": "Smith-Magenis Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:182290",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Although not a perfect match, Smith-Magenis syndrome presents intellectual disability and behavioral issues, and shares some cranial features, such as tented lip and hypotonia. However, the hyperlipidemia is not typical."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Rett Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312750",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Rett syndrome, primarily affecting females but possible in males with atypical presentations, includes developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. The presentation matches in some aspects, though not all features align perfectly."
