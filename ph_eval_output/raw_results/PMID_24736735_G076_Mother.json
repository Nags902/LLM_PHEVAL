      "disease_id": "OMIM:175700",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Greig Cephalopolysyndactyly Syndrome is characterized by preaxial polydactyly, syndactyly, and it can sometimes manifest in both hands and feet, similar to the patient's phenotypic features."

      "disease_name": "Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:209900",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl Syndrome often involves polydactyly and syndactyly, though it is more commonly associated with additional features like obesity and retinal dystrophy. It remains plausible given overlapping phenotypes."

      "disease_name": "Pallister-Hall Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:146510",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "Pallister-Hall Syndrome can feature polydactyly and syndactyly. Although typically associated with hypothalamic hamartomas, the less specific features of polydactyly and syndactyly warrant consideration."

      "disease_name": "Acrocallosal Syndrome, Schinzel Type",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:200990",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Acrocallosal Syndrome includes preaxial polydactyly and syndactyly, along with agenesis of the corpus callosum and other abnormalities. The presence of similar limb anomalies provides a basis for inclusion in this list."
