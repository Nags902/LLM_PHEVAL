      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Perfect match with all major features: highly elevated CK, calf pseudohypertrophy, Gowers sign, proximal>distal weakness pattern, respiratory insufficiency, and typical age of onset in a male patient."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:300376",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similar dystrophinopathy with elevated CK and muscle weakness, but typically milder and later onset. The severe presentation at age 5 with respiratory insufficiency favors DMD."
    },

      "disease_name": "Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2C",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:253700",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Gamma-sarcoglycanopathy can present similarly with proximal weakness, elevated CK, and calf hypertrophy, but Gowers sign and respiratory involvement at this age are less typical."

      "explanation": "Alpha-sarcoglycanopathy presents with similar features but usually has later onset and less prominent calf pseudohypertrophy than seen in this patient."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:607855",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "MDC1A (merosin-deficient) can cause early weakness and hyperlordosis, but typically presents from birth with more severe motor delays and white matter changes on MRI."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:253400",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "SMA3 can present with proximal weakness and motor delays, but typically has normal or low CK levels and lacks calf pseudohypertrophy."
