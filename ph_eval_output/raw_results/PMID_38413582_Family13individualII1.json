      "disease_name": "Muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, autosomal recessive 29",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:618771",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms closely match those of the reference cases, including proximal and distal muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase, calf muscle pseudohypertrophy, Gowers sign, and respiratory insufficiency."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:310200",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits classic signs of Duchenne muscular dystrophy such as proximal muscle weakness, Gowers sign, calf pseudohypertrophy, and highly elevated creatine kinase, though the autosomal recessive pattern in the reference cases suggests a different subtype."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Becker muscular dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300376",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Similar to Duchenne but with a milder phenotype, the patient's symptoms could align with Becker muscular dystrophy, though the age and severity might suggest otherwise."

      "disease_name": "Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:310300",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This condition shares some features like muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency, but typically includes joint contractures and cardiac abnormalities which are not mentioned here."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Spinal muscular atrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:253300",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "While spinal muscular atrophy can present with muscle weakness and respiratory issues, the elevated creatine kinase and pseudohypertrophy are less common, making this a less likely diagnosis."
