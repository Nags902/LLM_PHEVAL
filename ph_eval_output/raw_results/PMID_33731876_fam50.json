      "disease_name": "Dravet Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607208",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Dravet Syndrome is characterized by severe epilepsy that begins in infancy, with multiple types of seizures including myoclonic, tonic, and focal seizures. Intellectual disability, hypotonia, and choreoathetosis are common, aligning well with the patient's symptoms."

    {
      "disease_name": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 13",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:615473",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition involves severe intellectual disability, multifocal epileptiform discharges, hypsarrhythmia, and a variety of seizure types. The combination of these features makes it a possible match for the provided phenotypic features."

      "disease_name": "West Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "West Syndrome is characterized by hypsarrhythmia, intellectual disability, and multiple seizure types. Although not perfectly matching all symptoms, it is relevant due to the presence of hypsarrhythmia and severe intellectual disability."

    {
      "disease_name": "Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:606369",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome typically presents with multiple types of seizures and intellectual disability, and while hypsarrhythmia is not typical, the broad spectrum of seizures fits somewhat with the symptom profile."

    {
      "disease_name": "Rett Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312750",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Rett Syndrome is associated with severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, and often multiple types of seizures. Choreoathetosis and spike-wave discharges can occur, though it's a less direct match due to the typical female prevalence."
