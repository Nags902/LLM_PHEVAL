      "disease_name": "Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia, Autosomal Recessive",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:218400",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This is the most compelling candidate due to the strong match with multiple key features. Autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia (AR-CMD) is characterized by severe bone modeling defects, including marked diaphyseal undertubulation (leading to 'Erlenmeyer flask' deformity of long bones), which is a specific and central phenotypic finding in this patient. Craniofacial involvement is also prominent, leading to skull hyperostosis, proptosis (due to orbital narrowing), and abnormal skull shape like a flat occiput. Recurrent fractures and osteopenia are common in AR-CMD due to the severe generalized bone abnormalities and increased fragility. Delayed gross motor development and pes planus are consistent with a severe skeletal dysplasia affecting mobility."

      "disease_name": "Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia, Autosomal Dominant",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:123000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similar to the recessive form, autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia (AD-CMD) is a strong candidate because it directly accounts for the key features of diaphyseal undertubulation and craniofacial anomalies such as proptosis and skull deformities (e.g., flat occiput). While typically milder than the recessive form, bone fragility, osteopenia, and recurrent fractures can occur, although perhaps less consistently severe than in AR-CMD. Delayed gross motor development and pes planus are also compatible with this condition."

      "disease_name": "Craniodiaphyseal Dysplasia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:122860",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Craniodiaphyseal Dysplasia (CDD) is a strong consideration due to its profound impact on both cranial and diaphyseal bone. It features severe, progressive hyperostosis of the skull and facial bones, which directly explains the proptosis and flat occiput. It also involves severe diaphyseal anomalies, including a lack of normal modeling which can result in wide or undertubulated diaphyses. While CDD is classically associated with increased bone density (sclerosis), the abnormal bone microstructure can paradoxically lead to fragility and pathological fractures. The presence of 'osteopenia' might reflect an overall poor bone quality or areas of structural weakness despite increased density."

      "disease_name": "Frontometaphyseal Dysplasia 1, X-linked",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:305620",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Frontometaphyseal dysplasia (FMD) involves characteristic skull and facial bone hyperostosis which can lead to proptosis, and skeletal abnormalities affecting long bone metaphyses and diaphyses (often including widening or undertubulation). Delayed motor development and pes planus are also consistent. However, osteopenia and recurrent fractures are generally less prominent or typical primary features compared to CMD or CDD, with progressive sclerosis being more common, making it a slightly less direct fit for the bone fragility aspects."

      "disease_name": "Osteogenesis Imperfecta, Type III",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:259420",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a primary consideration given the recurrent fractures and osteopenia, which are hallmark features of the disease. Type III is a severe, progressively deforming form, compatible with significant skeletal deformity, short stature, and potentially some skull involvement (e.g., flat occiput, and severe forms can rarely present with proptosis). However, the specific feature of 'diaphyseal undertubulation' is atypical for OI, where long bones are generally slender and may be bowed rather than wide due to a failure of modeling. Despite this inconsistency, the core bone fragility warrants its inclusion in the differential."
