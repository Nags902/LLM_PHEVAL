      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Most severe survivable form of OI with recurrent fractures, osteopenia, delayed motor development, and skeletal deformities. The narrow chest and flat occiput are consistent with severe OI phenotypes."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:259440",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Reference case 1 shows identical features including recurrent fractures, osteopenia, delayed motor development, pes planus, diaphyseal undertubulation, and proptosis. This is a recessive form of OI."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Moderate form of OI with recurrent fractures, osteopenia, and variable skeletal deformities. Compatible with the patient's age and presentation without mention of severe short stature."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:610967",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Characterized by recurrent fractures and osteopenia without blue sclerae. The diaphyseal undertubulation could be consistent, though hyperplastic callus formation is not mentioned."

      "explanation": "Features bone fragility with ocular proptosis, which matches the patient. However, typically includes craniosynostosis and hydrocephalus which are not mentioned."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:259450",

      "explanation": "Combines features of OI with congenital contractures. The recurrent fractures and osteopenia fit, but no mention of joint contractures in this patient."
