      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Features like truncal ataxia, dysmetria, broad-based gait, and intellectual disability are common in spinocerebellar ataxias, and this diagnosis was observed in a reference case with overlapping features."

      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "The constellation of ataxia (truncal and limb), hypotonia, and tremor suggests this genetic condition, although the absence of telangiectasia makes this less likely than other diagnoses."
