      "disease_id": "OMIM:256000",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Classic presentation with multiple mitochondrial complex deficiencies (I, IV, PDH), developmental regression, CNS demyelination, cerebral edema, and systemic involvement. Age of onset and rapid progression are typical."

      "disease_name": "Pyruvate dehydrogenase E1-alpha deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312170",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "PDH deficiency is present, along with developmental delay, feeding difficulties, and apnea. However, the multiple respiratory chain deficiencies suggest a more global mitochondrial disorder."
    },

      "disease_name": "Mitochondrial complex I deficiency, nuclear type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:252010",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Complex I deficiency with cardiomyopathy and developmental delay fits, but the additional complex IV and PDH deficiencies suggest a broader mitochondrial dysfunction."

      "disease_name": "Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:203700",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Features developmental regression and mitochondrial dysfunction, but typically presents with refractory seizures and liver involvement, which are not prominent here."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:245400",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with multiple respiratory chain deficiencies, developmental delay, and failure to thrive, but methylmalonic aciduria is not mentioned in the phenotype."

      "disease_name": "SURF1 deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:220110",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Typically causes isolated complex IV deficiency with Leigh-like presentation, but this case shows multiple complex deficiencies making it less likely."
