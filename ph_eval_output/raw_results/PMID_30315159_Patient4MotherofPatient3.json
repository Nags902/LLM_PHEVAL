      "explanation": "Perfect match with reference cases showing identical constellation of facial dysmorphism (broad/horizontal eyebrows, synophrys, telecanthus, deeply set eyes, upslanted palpebral fissures, bulbous nose, thin upper lip, wide mouth, mandibular prognathia), thrombocytopenia with platelet abnormalities (anisocytosis, increased MPV), and mild global developmental delay."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Features thrombocytopenia with platelet abnormalities and can have facial dysmorphism, but typically includes more severe bleeding tendencies and specific platelet granule abnormalities not mentioned in this case."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Shows synophrys, deeply set eyes, thin upper lip, and developmental delay, but typically includes more severe growth retardation, limb abnormalities, and doesn't classically feature thrombocytopenia."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:147920",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with characteristic facial features including broad eyebrows and developmental delay, but the facial gestalt is different (elongated palpebral fissures with eversion of lateral third of lower eyelid) and thrombocytopenia is not a typical feature."
