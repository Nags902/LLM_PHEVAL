      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Many of the phenotypic features such as synophrys, upslanted palpebral fissures, thin upper lip vermilion, mandibular prognathia, and developmental delay are consistent with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome. Thrombocytopenia and platelet anisocytosis have also been reported in some cases."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Features like telecanthus, thrombocytopenia, and developmental delay align with Jacobsen Syndrome, although it does not fully explain the facial features like synophrys."

      "explanation": "Some phenotypic overlaps, such as telecanthus and increased mean platelet volume, suggest a possibility of Noonan Syndrome 1, yet other facial features are less typical."
