      "disease_name": "Marfan syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:154700",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Classic presentation with aortic root aneurysm, mitral valve prolapse, dural ectasia, arachnodactyly, tall stature, high palate, and skeletal abnormalities. The combination of cardiovascular, skeletal, and ocular features strongly suggests Marfan syndrome."

      "disease_name": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:609192",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Shares aortic root aneurysm and arterial tortuosity with Marfan syndrome, but typically has more aggressive vascular disease. The absence of hypertelorism and bifid uvula makes this less likely than Marfan syndrome."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:610168",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Similar vascular features to LDS type 1, but caused by mutations in TGFBR2. The clinical presentation overlaps significantly with Marfan syndrome but lacks some distinctive LDS features."

      "disease_name": "Congenital contractural arachnodactyly",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:121050",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Features arachnodactyly and tall stature, but typically presents with contractures which are not mentioned. The presence of significant vascular involvement makes Marfan syndrome more likely."

    {
      "disease_name": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:130050",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with arterial complications and some skeletal features, but typically has more prominent skin involvement and different vascular manifestations than described here."

    {
      "disease_name": "MASS phenotype",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:604308",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Shares mitral valve prolapse, aortic root dilatation, striae, and skeletal features with Marfan syndrome but is typically milder. The presence of dural ectasia suggests full Marfan syndrome."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:182212",
      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "Has marfanoid features including arachnodactyly and skeletal abnormalities, but typically includes craniosynostosis and intellectual disability which are not mentioned here."
