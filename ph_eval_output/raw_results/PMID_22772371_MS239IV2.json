      "disease_id": "OMIM:614816",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient shares many phenotypic similarities with cases of Loeys-Dietz syndrome 4, such as high palate, abnormal sternum morphology, spondylolisthesis, arachnodactyly, pes planus, striae distensae, dural ectasia, mitral valve prolapse, aortic root aneurysm, arterial tortuosity, emphysema, tall stature, and protrusio acetabuli. Similar reference cases were diagnosed with this subtype, reinforcing its likelihood."

      "disease_name": "Marfan syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:154700",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Marfan syndrome shares many clinical features with the patient's symptoms, including aortic root aneurysm, mitral valve prolapse, dural ectasia, tall stature, arachnodactyly, striae distensae, and emphysema. Although not all features perfectly align, it remains a strong possibility due to the overlap in connective tissue manifestations."

      "disease_name": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:130050",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms such as arterial tortuosity, aortic root aneurysm, and striae distensae suggest Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type. However, the absence of some hallmark features, such as thin, translucent skin, reduces its likelihood compared to other options."
