      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Patient presents with classic Noonan syndrome features including short/broad neck, low posterior hairline, hypertelorism, downslanted palpebral fissures, ptosis, low-set ears, cardiomyopathy, growth delay, and feeding difficulties. The presence of cafe-au-lait spots and freckling, along with ADHD, strongly aligns with NS1 caused by PTPN11 mutations."

    {
      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:605275",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "All three reference cases with similar phenotypes were diagnosed with NS2. Patient shares many features including facial dysmorphisms, cardiac involvement, growth delay, and neurodevelopmental issues. NS2 (PTPN11-negative) presents similarly to NS1 but may have slightly different mutation spectrum."

    {
      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Formerly known as LEOPARD syndrome, this condition shares many features with classic Noonan syndrome but is distinguished by multiple lentigines/cafe-au-lait spots and freckling. The patient's pigmentary changes (freckling and cafe-au-lait spots) along with cardiomyopathy are particularly suggestive."

    {
      "disease_name": "Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:115150",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "CFC syndrome shares significant overlap with Noonan syndrome including facial features, cardiac involvement, growth delay, and developmental issues. The presence of skin findings (freckling, cafe-au-lait spots) and ADHD are consistent. However, lacks some typical CFC features like sparse hair or more severe intellectual disability."

    {
      "disease_name": "Costello syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:218040",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Part of the RASopathy spectrum with overlapping features including facial dysmorphisms, cardiomyopathy, growth delay, and developmental issues. The macrocephaly is particularly suggestive. However, lacks typical features like papillomata or more severe feeding difficulties seen in infancy."
