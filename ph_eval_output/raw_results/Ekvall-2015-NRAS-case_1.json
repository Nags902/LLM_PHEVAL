      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features closely align with those observed in Noonan Syndrome 2 cases, including freckling, various facial features like hypertelorism and downslanted palpebral fissures, as well as cardiomyopathy and developmental delays. These features are highly prevalent in similar case studies."

    {
      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome 1 shares many clinical features with the patient's presentation. While there may be variations in symptoms and severity, the resemblance in the phenotypic profile makes this condition a strong contender."

    {
      "disease_name": "Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:115150",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome is characterized by cardiomyopathy, facial dysmorphisms, and skin abnormalities. Some features such as low-set ears and broad forehead overlap with the patient's phenotype, though not as specifically aligned as those in Noonan Syndrome."

    {
      "disease_name": "Costello Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:218040",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Costello Syndrome can present with feeding difficulties and cardiac issues similar to the patient's symptoms. However, the specific dysmorphic features and freckling are more indicative of Noonan Syndrome, which places this disease lower on the list."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "KBG Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:148050",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "KBG Syndrome features include developmental delay and skeletal abnormalities. Although there are overlaps in some physical attributes, its complete presentation does not align as closely with the patient's features compared to the other syndromes listed."
