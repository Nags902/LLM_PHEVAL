      "disease_id": "OMIM:610732",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This is the top candidate due to significant overlap with the patient's phenotypic features, including short neck, low posterior hairline, growth delay, cardiomyopathy, bilateral ptosis, feeding difficulties, broad forehead, hypertelorism, downslanted palpebral fissures, low-set ears, cafe-au-lait spot, and freckling. Furthermore, the provided similar reference cases are all diagnosed as Noonan syndrome 2, strongly supporting this specific subtype."

    {
      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Formerly known as LEOPARD syndrome, this is a distinct subtype within the Noonan spectrum. It is a very strong candidate given the patient's 'Freckling' (multiple lentigines) and 'Cafe-au-lait spot,' which are hallmark features, in addition to the classic Noonan features like cardiomyopathy, growth delay, and characteristic facial dysmorphia (hypertelorism, ptosis, downslanted palpebral fissures, broad forehead, low-set ears, short/broad neck)."

      "disease_name": "Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:115150",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "CFC syndrome is a RASopathy that shares substantial clinical overlap with Noonan syndrome. The patient's features such as broad forehead, hypertelorism, ptosis, downslanted palpebral fissures, low-set ears, growth delay, feeding difficulties, cardiomyopathy, cafe-au-lait spots, ADHD, and notably, macrocephaly (which can be seen in CFC) make this a strong differential diagnosis."

    {
      "disease_name": "Costello syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:218040",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Costello syndrome is another RASopathy that presents with overlapping features, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, growth delay, feeding difficulties, neurodevelopmental issues (like ADHD), and characteristic facial features such as broad forehead and can include macrocephaly. While specific skin features like papillomata are not present, the overall constellation of symptoms warrants its consideration."

    {
      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "NF1 is considered due to the presence of hallmark skin findings such as 'Cafe-au-lait spot' and 'Freckling,' along with 'Macrocephaly' and 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.' However, the more specific facial dysmorphic features (e.g., short neck, low posterior hairline, bilateral ptosis, downslanted palpebral fissures, low-set ears) and cardiomyopathy are less typical primary features of NF1 compared to the other RASopathies."
