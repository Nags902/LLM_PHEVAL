      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (formerly LEOPARD Syndrome)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This condition is the most fitting diagnosis as it perfectly encapsulates the patient's distinctive features including freckling and cafe-au-lait spots (LEOPARD features), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, growth delay, and the characteristic craniofacial dysmorphism (hypertelorism, ptosis, downslanted palpebral fissures, broad/short neck, low posterior hairline, low-set ears). Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and feeding difficulties are also commonly associated. Multiple genes can cause this, with PTPN11 (OMIM:151100 for LEOPARD syndrome 1) being the most common."

    {
      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome is a strong contender as it shares a vast majority of the patient's phenotypic features, including cardiomyopathy (especially hypertrophic, prominent in RAF1, RIT1 related types), growth delay, feeding difficulties, ADHD, and the specific craniofacial characteristics (hypertelorism, ptosis, downslanted palpebral fissures, short/broad neck, low posterior hairline, low-set ears, broad forehead, macrocephaly). While not a primary feature of all Noonan subtypes, pigmentary changes can occur. Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines is considered part of the broader Noonan spectrum, making this a very close differential."

    {
      "disease_name": "Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:115150",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) Syndrome is a Rasopathy that shares significant clinical overlap with Noonan Syndrome. Key overlapping features include cardiomyopathy, growth delay, feeding difficulties, ADHD, and characteristic facial dysmorphism (hypertelorism, ptosis, downslanted palpebral fissures, broad forehead, macrocephaly). While not typically associated with prominent freckling or cafe-au-lait spots, its strong resemblance in cardiac, neurological, and facial features makes it a relevant differential diagnosis."

    {
      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis, Type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is considered due to the presence of cafe-au-lait spots and freckling, which are hallmark features of this condition. Other overlapping features include macrocephaly and ADHD. However, the specific constellation of craniofacial features (e.g., short neck, low posterior hairline, bilateral ptosis, specific eye shape) and the primary presentation of cardiomyopathy are less characteristic of NF1 compared to the Noonan/Rasopathy spectrum, positioning it lower in the rank but still a crucial differential given the pigmentary changes."
