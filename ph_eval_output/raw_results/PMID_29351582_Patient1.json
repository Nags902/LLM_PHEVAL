      "disease_id": "OMIM:619121",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms closely match those of the reference cases, including motor axonal neuropathy, distal lower limb amyotrophy, pes cavus, and loss of ambulation, which are hallmark features of this condition."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:601472",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This disease also presents with motor axonal neuropathy, distal amyotrophy, and pes cavus, though the facial-lingual fasciculations and ptosis are less typical."

      "disease_name": "Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:604320",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "While this disease includes weakness and amyotrophy, the presence of respiratory distress is not noted in the patient's features, making it less likely."

      "disease_name": "Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, type IIC",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:606071",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This condition shares some features like motor neuropathy and pes cavus, but the absence of sensory symptoms in the patient reduces its likelihood."
