      "disease_id": "OMIM:612267",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms closely match those of similar cases with this hereditary motor neuron disorder, including lower limb amyotrophy, pes cavus, motor axonal neuropathy, and loss of ambulation."

      "disease_name": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2A",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:118200",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This peripheral neuropathy presents with proximal weakness, atrophy, pes cavus, and sensory loss, which can resemble some of the patient's features like distal limb weakness and impaired sensation."

      "disease_name": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:253300",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Although primarily characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, the symptoms of facial weakness, limb weakness, and potential loss of ambulation may overlap in some cases."

      "disease_name": "Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:182600",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This condition could explain the gait disturbances and weakness, yet it is less likely given the significant atrophy and specific motor neuron involvement observed in the patient."
