      "disease_id": "OMIM:118210",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2A is characterized by distal lower limb amyotrophy, motor axonal neuropathy, steppage gait, absent Achilles reflex, impaired vibratory sensation, and frequent falls, which overlap significantly with the patient's symptoms."

      "disease_name": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Distal, Autosomal Dominant, 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:182960",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition includes distal amyotrophy, weakness of facial musculature, facial-lingual fasciculations, and motor axonal neuropathy, consistent with the patient's phenotype."

      "disease_name": "Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome 1A",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:608930",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes can cause weakness of facial musculature, ptosis, dysarthria, and delayed gross motor development, aligning with the patient's presentation."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:158900",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This muscular dystrophy type can lead to facial weakness, ptosis, and delayed motor milestones. However, it typically does not explain the motor axonal neuropathy observed."

      "disease_name": "Nemaline Myopathy 5",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:605355",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Features like weakness of facial musculature, dysarthria, and delayed gross motor development align, though it does not usually present with motor axonal neuropathy."
