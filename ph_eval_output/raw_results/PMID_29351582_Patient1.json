      "disease_id": "OMIM:601472",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms, including motor axonal neuropathy, pes cavus, distal lower limb amyotrophy, and steppage gait, are highly indicative of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT), specifically the axonal type 2D."

      "disease_name": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Respiratory Distress Type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:604320",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The presence of facial-lingual fasciculations, weakness of facial musculature, and delayed gross motor development suggest a possible neuromuscular disorder like Spinal Muscular Atrophy."

      "disease_name": "Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy, Type IIC",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:606071",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "This condition shares features such as distal amyotrophy, pes cavus, and motor neuropathy with the patient's symptoms, though it is less common."

      "disease_name": "Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:608931",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Ptosis, dysarthria, and weakness of facial musculature could be consistent with a congenital myasthenic syndrome, though other features like motor neuropathy are less typical."

    {
      "disease_name": "Friedreich Ataxia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:229300",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "While Friedreich Ataxia often includes pes cavus and impaired vibratory sensation, the absence of ataxia and the presence of motor axonal neuropathy make this less likely."
