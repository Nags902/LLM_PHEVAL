      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Classic presentation with postaxial polydactyly, brachydactyly, retinal dystrophy (nyctalopia, reduced visual acuity), and mild intellectual disability. BBS1 is the most common form."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:615981",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Another form of BBS with similar features including polydactyly, brachydactyly, retinal degeneration, and cognitive impairment. BBS2 mutations are the second most common."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:236700",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Presents with postaxial polydactyly and can have overlap with BBS. However, retinal dystrophy and intellectual disability are less common, making it less likely."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:203800",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Features retinal dystrophy with nyctalopia and reduced vision, but polydactyly is not typical. Brachydactyly can occur. Less likely due to absence of polydactyly as cardinal feature."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with polydactyly and intellectual disability, but retinal dystrophy is less common. The combination of features is less typical than BBS."
