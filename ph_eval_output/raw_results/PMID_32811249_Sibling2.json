      "explanation": "The patient presents with postaxial polydactyly, reduced visual acuity, nyctalopia, and mild intellectual disability, which are hallmark features of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome. Brachydactyly and clinodactyly of the 5th finger are also commonly associated with this condition."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome shares features such as reduced visual acuity and nyctalopia with the patient's phenotype. However, polydactyly is less common in Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome compared to Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, which affects the ranking."
