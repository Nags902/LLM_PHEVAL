      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Perfect match with Case 1 reference - all six phenotypic features (postaxial polydactyly, clinodactyly, brachydactyly, reduced visual acuity, nyctalopia, and mild intellectual disability) are consistent with BBS5."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Classic BBS presenting with polydactyly, retinal dystrophy (nyctalopia, reduced visual acuity), intellectual disability, and limb abnormalities. BBS1 is the most common form."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Shares postaxial polydactyly with BBS but typically lacks retinal involvement; however, some overlap exists and retinal features may develop later."

      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Can present with retinal dystrophy and intellectual disability but typically lacks polydactyly; included due to overlapping retinal and cognitive features."
