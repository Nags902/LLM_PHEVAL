      "explanation": "The presence of multiple cafe-au-lait spots and freckling are classic signs of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). Kyphosis and scoliosis are common skeletal manifestations in NF1. Astrocytomas are also reported in NF1 patients."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Shares some phenotypic features with NF1, particularly multiple cafe-au-lait spots and freckling. However, astrocytomas and skeletal manifestations like pectus excavatum are less characteristic, making it less likely."

      "explanation": "Characterized by skin changes like lentigines which may resemble freckling, as well as skeletal abnormalities such as kyphosis. However, the presence of astrocytomas is not typical."
