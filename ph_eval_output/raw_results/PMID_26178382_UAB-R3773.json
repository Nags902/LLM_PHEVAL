      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with multiple cafe-au-lait spots, freckling, pectus excavatum, kyphosis, scoliosis, and astrocytoma, which are hallmark features of Neurofibromatosis type 1. The similar reference cases also strongly support this diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome shares some features with Neurofibromatosis type 1, such as cafe-au-lait spots and freckling, but typically lacks the tumors and severe skeletal manifestations seen in this patient. However, it is a differential diagnosis to consider."

      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines can present with cafe-au-lait spots, pectus excavatum, and scoliosis, but the presence of astrocytoma and the pattern of freckling are more indicative of Neurofibromatosis type 1."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "McCune-Albright syndrome can present with cafe-au-lait spots and skeletal abnormalities, but the freckling and astrocytoma are not typical features, making this diagnosis less likely."
