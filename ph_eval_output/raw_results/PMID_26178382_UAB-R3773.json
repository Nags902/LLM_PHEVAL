      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This is the most likely diagnosis as the patient's phenotype perfectly aligns with classic Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) diagnostic criteria. Key features include multiple cafe-au-lait spots, freckling (often axillary/inguinal, though general freckling is consistent), various skeletal abnormalities such as pectus excavatum, kyphosis, and scoliosis, and the presence of an astrocytoma, which is a common CNS manifestation in NF1 (e.g., optic pathway gliomas or other low-grade astrocytomas)."

      "disease_name": "Constitutional Mismatch Repair Deficiency Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:276300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Constitutional Mismatch Repair Deficiency (CMMRD) is a strong differential diagnosis. Patients with CMMRD often present with multiple cafe-au-lait spots and have a significantly increased risk of various childhood cancers, including CNS tumors like astrocytomas. While freckling and severe skeletal manifestations like kyphosis and scoliosis are less typical primary features compared to NF1, the combination of prominent cafe-au-lait spots and astrocytoma warrants its high ranking as it can phenocopy NF1."

      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (formerly LEOPARD syndrome) shares some overlapping features such as freckling (multiple lentigines), pectus excavatum, and scoliosis. However, multiple cafe-au-lait spots are less characteristic and typically fewer than in NF1, and astrocytoma is not a common associated tumor, making it a less likely fit compared to NF1 or CMMRD given the patient's complete clinical picture."
