      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Patient presents with classic NF1 features including multiple cafe-au-lait spots, freckling, skeletal abnormalities (pectus excavatum, kyphosis, scoliosis), and astrocytoma. All three reference cases with similar presentations were diagnosed with NF1."

      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Also known as NF1-like syndrome, presents with cafe-au-lait spots and freckling similar to NF1, but typically lacks neurofibromas and CNS tumors. The presence of astrocytoma makes this less likely than NF1."
    },

      "disease_name": "Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:276300",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Can present with cafe-au-lait spots and brain tumors including astrocytomas, particularly in younger patients. However, the skeletal abnormalities and freckling pattern are more consistent with NF1."

      "disease_name": "McCune-Albright syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Features cafe-au-lait spots and skeletal abnormalities, but the spots typically have irregular borders and respect the midline. The presence of freckling and astrocytoma are not typical features."

      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis, type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:101000",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "While NF2 can present with CNS tumors, it typically lacks the extensive cutaneous manifestations seen in this patient. Cafe-au-lait spots are less common and freckling is not a typical feature."
