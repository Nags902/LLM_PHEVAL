      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Classic presentation with multiple cafe-au-lait spots, freckling, skeletal abnormalities (pectus excavatum, kyphosis, scoliosis), and astrocytoma. NF1 is strongly associated with optic pathway gliomas and other astrocytomas."

      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Presents with cafe-au-lait spots and freckling similar to NF1, but typically lacks neurofibromas. However, the presence of astrocytoma and skeletal abnormalities makes this less likely than NF1."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Can present with cafe-au-lait spots, pectus excavatum, and spinal abnormalities. However, astrocytomas are not typical, and other characteristic features like short stature and facial dysmorphism are not mentioned."

      "disease_name": "Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:276300",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Can present with cafe-au-lait spots and early-onset brain tumors including gliomas. However, would typically have additional features like colorectal polyps and other malignancies."

    {
      "disease_name": "McCune-Albright syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Presents with cafe-au-lait spots and skeletal abnormalities, but the spots typically have irregular borders and follow Blaschko's lines. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia rather than the described skeletal features would be expected."
