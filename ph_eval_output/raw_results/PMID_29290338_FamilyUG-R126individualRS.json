      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with classic features of Neurofibromatosis type 1 including plexiform neurofibroma, freckling, and multiple cafe-au-lait spots which are characteristic of this condition."

      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis, type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:101000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While Neurofibromatosis type 2 does involve tumors, it is less likely in this case as cafe-au-lait spots and freckling are more tightly associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1. However, it's included due to similarity in tumor predisposition."

      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome can present with caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and axillary freckling, though plexiform neurofibromas are not typical. It is included due to overlapping phenotypic features."
