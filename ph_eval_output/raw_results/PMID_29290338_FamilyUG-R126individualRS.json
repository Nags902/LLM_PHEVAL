      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome shares features like cafe-au-lait spots and freckling with Neurofibromatosis type 1, but typically lacks neurofibromas. The presence of plexiform neurofibroma makes this less likely."

      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This syndrome combines features of Neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome. The absence of Noonan-specific features like short stature or heart defects makes this less likely."
