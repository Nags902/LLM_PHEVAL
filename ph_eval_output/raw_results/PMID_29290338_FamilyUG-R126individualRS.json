      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The presence of plexiform neurofibroma, multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and freckling (often axillary or inguinal, known as Crowe's sign) constitutes a classic diagnostic triad for Neurofibromatosis Type 1. Plexiform neurofibromas are highly specific to NF1 and are a major diagnostic criterion, making this the overwhelmingly most likely diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Legius Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome is considered in the differential diagnosis of NF1 due to the presence of multiple cafe-au-lait spots and freckling. However, it is primarily distinguished by the absence of neurofibromas (including plexiform neurofibromas) and other NF1-related complications, making it a less likely but still relevant consideration given the patient's full phenotype."

      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome With Multiple Lentigines",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (formerly LEOPARD syndrome) can present with cafe-au-lait spots and lentigines (which might be broadly described as freckling). However, plexiform neurofibromas are not a characteristic feature of this condition, and typically other cardinal features of Noonan syndrome would be present, making it a distant possibility."
