      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Classic triad of multiple cafe-au-lait spots, freckling (especially axillary/inguinal), and plexiform neurofibromas perfectly matches the patient's presentation. All three reference cases with identical phenotypes were diagnosed with NF1."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:162260",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Rare variant of neurofibromatosis that can present with cafe-au-lait spots and neurofibromas, though typically has more prominent CNS tumors. Less likely than NF1 but should be considered."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Allelic to NF1, presents with cafe-au-lait spots and freckling, but typically includes pulmonary stenosis and intellectual disability, which are not reported in this patient."

      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "NF1-like syndrome with cafe-au-lait spots and freckling, but specifically lacks neurofibromas. The presence of plexiform neurofibroma makes this diagnosis unlikely."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with cafe-au-lait spots, but these typically have irregular borders and are associated with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and endocrinopathies, not neurofibromas."
