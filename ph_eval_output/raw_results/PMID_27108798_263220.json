      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Classic triad of cerebellar ataxia, partial aniridia/iris hypoplasia, and intellectual disability matches perfectly. The cerebellar hypoplasia/atrophy, hypotonia, and motor delays are characteristic features."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Cerebellar hypoplasia, ataxia, hypotonia, intellectual disability, and visual impairment are core features. However, iris hypoplasia is not typical, and molar tooth sign on MRI would be expected."

      "explanation": "Cerebellar atrophy and ataxia are present, but onset is typically later, and peripheral neuropathy features are not described. The ocular findings also don't fit."
