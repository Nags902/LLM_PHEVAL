      "disease_id": "OMIM:603041",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms, including myopathic abnormalities, respiratory failure, hypotonia, and metabolic acidosis, are consistent with mitochondrial disorders. Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome often presents with these features, including cardiorespiratory involvement."

      "disease_name": "Pompe disease (Glycogen storage disease type II)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:232300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Pompe disease can present with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypotonia, and respiratory distress in infants. The presence of myopathic abnormalities and respiratory failure also aligns with this diagnosis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:256000",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Leigh syndrome is a mitochondrial disorder that can present with metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, and nystagmus. The patient's neurological and respiratory symptoms are consistent with this condition."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:604320",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "SMARD1 presents with respiratory distress, hypotonia, and peripheral neuropathy. The patient's respiratory failure and peripheral neuropathy suggest this could be a potential diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Congenital myasthenic syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:608931",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Congenital myasthenic syndromes can present with hypotonia, respiratory failure, and hyporeflexia. The patient's symptoms, including myopathic abnormalities, could be indicative of this condition."
