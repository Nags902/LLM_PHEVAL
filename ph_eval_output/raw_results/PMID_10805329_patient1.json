      "disease_id": "OMIM:609015",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This condition fits due to the presence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, and peripheral neuropathy, which are hallmark features of mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency."

      "disease_name": "Leigh syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:256000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Leigh syndrome is a possible consideration given the metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, and nystagmus, but the absence of clear CNS lesions makes it less likely than mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency."

      "disease_name": "Pompe disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:232300",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Pompe disease can present with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypotonia, but the presence of peripheral neuropathy and metabolic acidosis is less typical, making it a lower-ranked possibility."

      "disease_name": "Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:604320",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This condition could explain the respiratory distress and hypotonia, but the presence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and metabolic acidosis is not typical, lowering its rank."

      "disease_name": "Glycogen storage disease type IIb (Danon disease)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300257",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Danon disease can present with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myopathic EMG findings, but the metabolic acidosis and peripheral neuropathy are atypical, making it a less likely diagnosis."
