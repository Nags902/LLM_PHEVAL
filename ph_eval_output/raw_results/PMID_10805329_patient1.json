      "disease_id": "OMIM:619060",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features closely match those of similar cases diagnosed with Mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, nuclear type 2, including myopathic abnormalities, congestive heart failure, respiratory failure, and metabolic acidosis."

      "disease_name": "Muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, autosomal recessive 28",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:618135",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While the patient shares some features like myopathic abnormalities and respiratory failure with this condition, the absence of specific features like limb-girdle weakness and joint contractures makes this less likely."

      "disease_name": "Leigh syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:256000",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Leigh syndrome can present with similar features such as metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but the absence of neurodevelopmental regression and brain imaging findings makes it less likely."

      "disease_name": "Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:604320",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This condition shares features like respiratory distress and hypotonia, but the presence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and metabolic acidosis is more indicative of a mitochondrial disorder."
