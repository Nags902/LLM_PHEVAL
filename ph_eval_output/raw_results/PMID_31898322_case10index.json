      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features such as mitral regurgitation, scoliosis, dural ectasia, and tall stature are highly consistent with Loeys-Dietz syndrome 1, as seen in the similar reference cases."

      "disease_name": "Marfan syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:154700",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Marfan syndrome shares features like mitral regurgitation, scoliosis, tall stature, and dural ectasia with the patient's presentation, though the absence of lens dislocation and other classic features makes it less likely than Loeys-Dietz syndrome."

      "disease_name": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:130050",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "The vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can present with mitral regurgitation and dural ectasia, but the lack of significant skin hyperextensibility or joint hypermobility in the patient's features reduces its likelihood."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:182212",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This syndrome includes features like scoliosis and tall stature, but the absence of craniosynostosis and other distinctive features makes it a less likely diagnosis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:108300",

      "explanation": "Stickler syndrome can present with mitral regurgitation and scoliosis, but the lack of retinal detachment or hearing loss in the patient's features reduces its likelihood."
