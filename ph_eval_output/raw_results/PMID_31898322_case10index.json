      "explanation": "Shares connective tissue features with Marfan including scoliosis, tall stature, and cardiac involvement. Downslanted palpebral fissures are characteristic."

      "explanation": "FBN2-related disorder with marfanoid habitus, tall stature, and scoliosis. Less likely due to absence of contractures and presence of dural ectasia."
