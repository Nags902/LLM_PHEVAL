      "disease_name": "Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:201910",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The phenotypic features and previous similar cases strongly suggest Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, particularly due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, as all listed features align precisely with this condition, including hormonal imbalances such as increased ACTH, decreased cortisol, and altered sex steroid levels."

    {
      "disease_name": "Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia due to 11\u03b2-hydroxylase deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:202010",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Another type of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia caused by 11\u03b2-hydroxylase deficiency may present with similar hormonal imbalances. While 21-hydroxylase deficiency is more common, 11\u03b2-hydroxylase deficiency should be considered given the overlap in several hormonal features, although the phenotype matches less closely than the first disease."

    {
      "disease_name": "Pituitary Adenoma",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:102200",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Pituitary adenomas can cause increased prolactin and ACTH levels, along with other hormone disturbances. While not the most common presentation, the overlap in characteristics necessitates consideration."

    {
      "disease_name": "Adrenocortical Carcinoma",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:202300",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Adrenocortical carcinoma can cause diverse hormone secretion patterns including those that mimic adrenal hyperplasia. Although usually more severe, the hormonal irregularities suggest it as a potential differential diagnosis, albeit with a lower likelihood."
