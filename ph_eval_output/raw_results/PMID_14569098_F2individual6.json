      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features closely match those of similar reference cases diagnosed with this condition, including chronic kidney disease, gout, renal cyst, and renal interstitial fibrosis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:162000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition is also a strong candidate given the similarity to reference cases, particularly with the presence of chronic kidney disease, gout, renal cyst, and renal interstitial fibrosis."

      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This disease can present with renal cysts and chronic kidney disease, but the absence of liver cysts or other typical features makes it less likely compared to the tubulointerstitial kidney diseases."

      "explanation": "This condition is associated with gout and chronic kidney disease, but the presence of renal cysts and interstitial fibrosis is less typical, making it a lower-ranked candidate."
