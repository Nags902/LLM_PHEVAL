      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Exact match with Case 1 reference showing all three features (short stature, short metacarpal, intellectual disability). PHP1A is characterized by Albright hereditary osteodystrophy features including these symptoms."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:612463",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Strong match with Case 2 reference, sharing all three core features. PPHP presents with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy phenotype without hormone resistance."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:612462",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "PHP1C presents with similar features to PHP1A including short stature, brachydactyly, and intellectual disability, but with different molecular etiology."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:101800",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Presents with short stature, brachydactyly (short metacarpals), and intellectual disability. Often confused with pseudohypoparathyroidism due to overlapping features."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Similar to Acrodysostosis 1 with short stature, short metacarpals, and variable intellectual disability, caused by PDE4D mutations."
