      "disease_id": "OMIM:772000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Patau Syndrome can present with polydactyly, microcephaly, and structural brain malformations such as Chiari malformation, making it a possible match for the patient's features."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:609inger177",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Bardet-Biedl Syndrome exhibits postaxial polydactyly and can be associated with renal and neurological anomalies, justifying its relevance with the patient's symptoms."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:607451",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "While not directly correlating with all phenotypes, spina bifida can lead to additional complications that align with lumbosacral meningocele and lower limb malformations, supporting its inclusion."
