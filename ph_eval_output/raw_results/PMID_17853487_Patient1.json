      "disease_id": "OMIM:249000",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Classic presentation with occipital encephalocele/meningocele, postaxial polydactyly, and cystic renal disease. The lumbosacral meningocele and Chiari II malformation align with the neural tube defects seen in Meckel syndrome."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:236680",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Features postaxial polydactyly, CNS malformations including hydrocephalus, and clubfoot. The neural tube defects and polydactyly pattern match well with this patient."

      "disease_name": "Joubert syndrome 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:608091",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Can present with polydactyly and CNS malformations, though typically features the characteristic molar tooth sign. The Chiari II malformation could represent a CNS anomaly variant."

      "disease_name": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:270400",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Features microcephaly, postaxial polydactyly, and clubfoot. While neural tube defects are less common, they can occur in severe cases."

      "disease_name": "Bardet-Biedl syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:209900",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Classically presents with postaxial polydactyly and can have CNS anomalies, though neural tube defects are not typical features."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:146510",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Features postaxial polydactyly and CNS malformations, typically hypothalamic hamartoma. The neural tube defects seen here are atypical but possible."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:264480",
      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "Common features include microcephaly, postaxial polydactyly, and neural tube defects. Clubfoot can also occur. Chromosomal analysis would confirm."
