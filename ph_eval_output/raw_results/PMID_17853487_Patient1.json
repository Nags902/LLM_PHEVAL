      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Meckel syndrome is characterized by the presence of microcephaly, polydactyly, Chiari malformation, and meningocele, which align closely with the patient's features."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:213300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Joubert syndrome can present with features such as microcephaly, polydactyly, and malformations in the brain, similar to the Chiari malformation observed in this patient."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:209900",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Bardet-Biedl syndrome often includes postaxial polydactyly and neurological features. Although not a perfect match, it shares several significant phenotypic overlaps with the patient's presentation."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:270400",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This syndrome presents with microcephaly and structural brain abnormalities. Though polydactyly is less common, the condition shares some of the neurological aspects with the patient."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:311200",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Microcephaly and polydactyly are features of orofaciodigital syndromes. The specific neurological and skeletal features observed may align, but it's a less likely candidate given the data."
