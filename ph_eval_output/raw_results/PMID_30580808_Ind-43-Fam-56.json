      "explanation": "Patient presents with hypertelorism and orofacial cleft, which are key features of CFND. All three reference cases with similar presentations were diagnosed with this condition. CFND is an X-linked disorder that paradoxically affects females more severely than males, which could explain the presentation in this male patient."
