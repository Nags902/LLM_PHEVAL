      "disease_id": "OMIM:252010",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Presents in infancy with hypotonia, developmental delay, increased lactate, and hypoglycemia. The combination of lactic acidosis with neurological symptoms strongly suggests mitochondrial disease."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:266150",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Classic presentation includes lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, and developmental delay in infancy. Coagulation abnormalities can occur due to liver dysfunction."

      "disease_name": "Glycogen Storage Disease Type Ia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:232200",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Presents with severe hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and hypotonia in infancy. Coagulation defects occur due to platelet dysfunction. Developmental delay is less common but possible."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:220110",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Another mitochondrial disorder presenting with lactic acidosis, hypotonia, and developmental delay in infancy. Hypoglycemia and coagulopathy can occur as secondary features."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Presents with hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and hypotonia during metabolic stress. Developmental delay is not typical but can occur with severe episodes."
