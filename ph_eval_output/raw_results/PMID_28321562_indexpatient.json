      "disease_id": "OMIM:109150",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph Disease, is the most common autosomal dominant SCA and is an excellent match for the patient's phenotypic features. It is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, prominent spasticity (both upper and lower limbs), dysarthria, dysmetria, gait imbalance, and frequently includes cerebellar atrophy, often affecting the vermis. The patient's age of 39 years falls well within the typical age of onset for SCA3."

      "disease_name": "Autosomal Recessive Spastic Paraplegia Type 7",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607259",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Autosomal Recessive Spastic Paraplegia Type 7 (SPG7) is a common complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia. It presents with a combination of progressive spastic paraplegia and cerebellar ataxia, directly accounting for the 'spastic ataxia' and both upper/lower limb spasticity. Cerebellar vermis atrophy, dysarthria, dysmetria, and gait imbalance are well-documented features. Adult onset is typical, making it a very strong candidate, especially given the significant spastic component."

      "disease_name": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:164400",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 (SCA1) is another significant autosomal dominant SCA that aligns well with the patient's symptoms. It is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, and frequently includes prominent pyramidal signs, such as spasticity in the upper and lower limbs. Cerebellar and brainstem atrophy are common findings. The patient's age and the full symptom profile are highly consistent with SCA1."

      "disease_name": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:183090",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2 (SCA2) shares substantial phenotypic overlap with other common SCAs like SCA1 and SCA3. It presents with progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, and can include pyramidal signs like spasticity. Cerebellar atrophy is a typical finding. While slow saccades are a hallmark, they are not a listed symptom; however, the core features of spastic ataxia, dysarthria, and cerebellar atrophy make SCA2 a strong differential diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Multiple System Atrophy, Cerebellar Type",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:146500",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Multiple System Atrophy, Cerebellar Type (MSA-C) is a sporadic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a predominant cerebellar syndrome, including ataxia, dysarthria, and often pyramidal signs (spasticity), along with autonomic dysfunction (not listed here but common). Cerebellar atrophy, especially of the vermis, is a hallmark. While the typical age of onset is later (50s-60s), earlier onset cases occur, and the symptom complex closely matches the patient's presentation of spastic ataxia with cerebellar involvement."
