      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms of spasticity, ataxia, and dysarthria closely align with those seen in Spastic Paraplegia 15, particularly the combination of upper and lower limb involvement along with gait imbalance."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Clinical features such as gait imbalance, dysmetria, dysarthria, and cerebellar vermis atrophy are consistent with Spinocerebellar Ataxia. This condition has a strong correlation with the cerebellar features presented."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:182600",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Lower and upper limb spasticity, together with muscle weakness, suggest hereditary spastic paraplegia could be a potential diagnosis, particularly if other identified patterns of inheritance or associated features are present."
