      "disease_id": "OMIM:615904",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The combination of feeding difficulties, neonatal hypoglycemia, intellectual disability, prominent fingertip pads, intrauterine growth retardation, horseshoe kidney, and clinodactyly aligns well with the phenotypic features of Tarnowsky Syndrome."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:222748",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The presence of intellectual disability, developmental delay, and distinct facial features alongside growth anomalies fits within Dubowitz Syndrome's known manifestations."

      "disease_name": "Williams Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:194050",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "While not all features are characteristic, the presence of feeding difficulties, developmental delays, and facial dysmorphisms can sometimes correspond with Williams Syndrome."

      "disease_name": "Prader-Willi Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:176270",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This syndrome often presents with feeding difficulties in infancy and can include developmental delays and intellectual disabilities, though not all phenotypic features match."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:610000",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "While this syndrome encompasses a wide range of serious anomalies and disabilities, the presence of intrauterine growth retardation and abnormal facial shape can suggest Patau Syndrome as a differential diagnosis."
