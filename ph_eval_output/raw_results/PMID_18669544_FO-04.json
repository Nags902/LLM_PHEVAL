      "explanation": "Patient presents with 4/5 major features of BBS (retinal dystrophy with myopia/nyctalopia/reduced visual acuity, obesity, intellectual disability). All three reference cases with identical phenotypes were diagnosed with BBS1. Missing polydactyly but this is not present in all BBS patients."

      "explanation": "BBS2 presents with similar clinical features as BBS1 including retinal dystrophy, obesity, and intellectual disability. Different genetic cause but phenotypically very similar to BBS1."
