      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This disease is closely aligned with the patient's symptoms of gait ataxia, delayed ability to walk, global developmental delay, and borderline intellectual disability. It was also a diagnosis in similar cases."

      "explanation": "While this condition primarily affects intellectual development, it shares similarities in global developmental delay and speech language delays noted in the patient and reference cases."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "This disorder could account for the gait ataxia and motor delays observed, although it may not fully explain the cognitive and speech delays."

      "explanation": "This condition includes ataxia and may involve developmental delays. While it's a less common presentation at this age, it should be considered due to overlapping features."
