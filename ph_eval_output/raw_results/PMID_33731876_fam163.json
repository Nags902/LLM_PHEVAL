      "disease_id": "OMIM:612621",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This condition is strongly associated with the core features of intellectual disability (often moderate to severe), autism spectrum disorder, and epilepsy, including generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The triad of symptoms aligns very well."

      "disease_name": "ADNP syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:615873",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "ADNP syndrome frequently presents with intellectual disability (ranging from mild to severe), autism spectrum disorder, and a high prevalence of seizures, including tonic-clonic types, making it a strong candidate."

      "disease_name": "Epileptic encephalopathy, early infantile, 11",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613721",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Caused by mutations in SCN2A, this disorder is characterized by early-onset, often intractable seizures (including bilateral tonic-clonic), significant intellectual disability, and frequently features of autism spectrum disorder, aligning well with the patient's presentation."

      "disease_name": "Phelan-McDermid syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:606232",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Phelan-McDermid syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability (typically moderate to severe), prominent autism spectrum disorder features, and a significant percentage of affected individuals also experience seizures, including tonic-clonic types."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Pitt-Hopkins syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:610954",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Pitt-Hopkins syndrome commonly presents with moderate to severe intellectual disability, distinctive facial features (not listed but typical), and a high incidence of autism spectrum disorder and various seizure types, including generalized tonic-clonic seizures."

    {
      "disease_name": "GRIN2B-related neurodevelopmental disorder",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611029",
      "score": 0.16666666666666666,
      "explanation": "Mutations in GRIN2B are associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, frequently including intellectual disability of variable severity (often moderate), autism spectrum disorder, and epilepsy with diverse seizure types such as tonic-clonic."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Fragile X syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300624",
      "score": 0.14285714285714285,
      "explanation": "Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability (often moderate in males) and is highly associated with autism spectrum disorder. Epilepsy, including tonic-clonic seizures, occurs in a notable minority of affected individuals."
