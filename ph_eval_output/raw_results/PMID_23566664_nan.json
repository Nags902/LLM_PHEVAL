      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This condition is characterized by short stature, thick eyebrows, micrognathia, and osteoporosis, similar to the provided phenotype. Osteolytic defects of the hand and vertebrae involvement further suggest KBG syndrome as the top candidate."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:102500",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Hajdu-Cheney syndrome involves facial dysmorphisms such as micrognathia and large earlobes, along with osteolytic bone changes and osteoporosis, making it a plausible match."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:154700",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Characterized by skeletal abnormalities, including osteoporosis and vertebral compression fractures; however, less compelling due to lack of cardinal features like arachnodactyly."

      "disease_name": "Pycnodysostosis",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:265800",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This disorder features short stature, micrognathia, and osteolytic lesions, aligning moderately with the patient's features, though the facial phenotype is less typical."
