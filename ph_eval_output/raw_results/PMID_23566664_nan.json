      "disease_name": "KBG Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:148050",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotype closely matches KBG syndrome which includes features like thick eyebrows, short stature, and hand anomalies. The presence of osteoporosis and vertebral issues aligns with the skeletal manifestations seen in this syndrome."

    {
      "disease_name": "Syndrome X (including conditions like Osteogenesis Imperfecta)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:166210",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The combination of osteoporosis, micrognathia, and osteolytic defects of the phalanges is suggestive of osteogenesis imperfecta, even though this case does not fully match other typical features."

      "disease_name": "Apert Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:101200",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This syndrome can present with craniosynostosis, flat facial features, and other hand deformities which are reminiscent of the patient's short stature and facial features, although not all features align perfectly."

    {
      "disease_name": "Crouzon Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:123500",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "While primarily characterized by craniofacial dysostosis, Crouzon syndrome could explain some facial features and hand issues observed in the patient, but does not fully account for the back pain or osteoporosis."

    {
      "disease_name": "Marfan Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:154700",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Although typically associated with tall stature and arachnodactyly, Marfan syndrome can have variable expressiveness including musculoskeletal issues, which could connect to the patient's symptoms."
