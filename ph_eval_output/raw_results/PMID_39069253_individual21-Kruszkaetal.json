      "disease_id": "OMIM:601121",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The presence of autistic behavior in conjunction with developmental delays and dysmorphic traits supports a diagnosis within the spectrum of autism spectrum disorders, reflecting similarities to Case 3."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:101600",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This syndrome is characterized by craniosynostosis and dysmorphic features. Some of the patient's features, such as the prominent metopic ridge and facial characteristics, suggest a possible alignment."
