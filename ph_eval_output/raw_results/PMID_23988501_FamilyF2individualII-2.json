      "explanation": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD1) is a common genetic disorder associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), often leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It is prevalent and should be considered as a primary cause for stage 5 CKD in adults."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD2) is another form of genetic kidney disorder similar to PKD1. Although less common, it also frequently leads to CKD and ESRD by middle age."

      "explanation": "Alport syndrome is characterized by progressive renal disease, and in its X-linked form, typically presents with kidney disease symptoms like CKD. The X-linked form is more common and can be a possible cause for renal failure."
