      "explanation": "All three reference cases with identical presentation (Stage 5 CKD) were diagnosed with this condition. ADTKD-UMOD is caused by UMOD mutations and typically presents with progressive CKD in adulthood."

      "explanation": "PKD2 has a milder phenotype than PKD1 but can still lead to ESRD in middle age. Absence of cyst description makes this less likely."
