      "disease_name": "Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:605376",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents a cluster of symptoms including Achilles tendon contracture, gait disturbance, spinal rigidity, arrhythmia, scapuloperoneal amyotrophy, and proximal muscle weakness in upper limbs that align closely with cases of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, which is known for these specific phenotypic features."

    {
      "disease_name": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:310200",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy may involve similar muscular weaknesses and contractures, although the presence of arrhythmia and specific amyotrophy patterns makes Emery-Dreifuss more likely. However, some symptoms such as proximal weakness and gait disturbance are also noted in this condition."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Congenital Muscular Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601679",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Congenital muscular dystrophies feature muscle weakness and contractures, but the additional presence of arrhythmia and scapuloperoneal amyotrophy leans towards Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Nevertheless, it remains a differential diagnosis due to overlap in muscle disease symptoms."
