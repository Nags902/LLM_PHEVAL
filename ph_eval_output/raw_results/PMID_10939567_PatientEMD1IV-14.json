      "disease_id": "OMIM:181350",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features, including Achilles tendon contracture, gait disturbance, spinal rigidity, arrhythmia, scapuloperoneal amyotrophy, proximal muscle weakness in upper limbs, and stiff neck, closely match the phenotypic features of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 2 as seen in the reference cases."

      "disease_name": "Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 1, X-linked",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:310300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This X-linked form of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy shares many features with the autosomal dominant form, including contractures, muscle weakness, and cardiac involvement, but the patient's gender (female) makes this less likely."

    {
      "disease_name": "Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:Multiple subtypes",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy can present with proximal muscle weakness and gait disturbance, but the presence of early contractures and arrhythmia makes this less likely compared to Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy."

      "disease_name": "Myotonic dystrophy type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:160900",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Myotonic dystrophy can present with muscle weakness and arrhythmia, but the absence of myotonia and the presence of early contractures makes this less likely."

      "disease_name": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:158900",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy can present with scapular muscle weakness, but the presence of early contractures and cardiac involvement is atypical for this condition."
