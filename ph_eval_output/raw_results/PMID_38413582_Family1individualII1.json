      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Male patient with progressive proximal > distal weakness, Gowers sign, calf pseudohypertrophy, highly elevated CK, and typical age of onset. Classic presentation of DMD."

      "disease_name": "Becker Muscular Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300376",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Milder allelic variant of dystrophinopathy. Similar features to DMD but typically later onset and slower progression. Age 9 with significant symptoms makes DMD more likely."
    },

      "disease_name": "Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2C",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:253700",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Gamma-sarcoglycanopathy can present similarly to DMD with proximal weakness, high CK, and calf hypertrophy, but less common than dystrophinopathies."

      "disease_name": "Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2D",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:608099",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Alpha-sarcoglycanopathy with severe childhood onset can mimic DMD. High CK and proximal weakness pattern fit, but calf pseudohypertrophy less common."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:604286",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Beta-sarcoglycanopathy with DMD-like presentation. Compatible features but less likely given typical DMD phenotype in male patient."

      "explanation": "FKRP-related dystrophy can have childhood onset with high CK and proximal weakness, but calf hypertrophy and Gowers sign less typical."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:310300",
      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "X-linked form with contractures and weakness, but typically has early contractures, cardiac involvement, and lower CK elevation than observed."
