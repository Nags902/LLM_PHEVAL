      "disease_name": "Muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, autosomal recessive 29",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:610458",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This disease matches closely with the phenotypic features such as proximal and distal muscle weakness, unsteady gait, scoliosis, increased endomysial connective tissue, highly elevated creatine kinase, calf muscle pseudohypertrophy, and Gowers sign, closely aligning with the reference cases."

    {
      "disease_name": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:310200",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Shares similar characteristics such as proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase levels, calf pseudohypertrophy, and Gowers sign. However, the absence of X-linked inheritance indication makes it less likely compared to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Becker Muscular Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300376",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Similar to Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy but with a typically milder phenotype, which also includes elevated creatine kinase, muscle weakness, and pseudohypertrophy. The level of severity and absence of X-linked traits makes it less likely."
