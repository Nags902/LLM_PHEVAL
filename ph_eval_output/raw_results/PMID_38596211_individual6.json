      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits multiple hallmark features of Neurofibromatosis type 1, including plexiform neurofibroma, axillary and inguinal freckling, multiple cafe-au-lait spots, scoliosis, and glioma, which closely match the reference cases provided."

      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome shares some features with Neurofibromatosis type 1, such as cafe-au-lait spots and freckling, but typically lacks tumors like plexiform neurofibromas and gliomas, making it a less likely but possible diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601321",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This rare syndrome combines features of Neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome. While the patient does not show typical Noonan syndrome features, the presence of Neurofibromatosis type 1 symptoms warrants consideration of this variant."

      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This condition includes freckling and cafe-au-lait spots but is distinguished by other features like cardiac abnormalities and facial dysmorphism, which are not mentioned in the patient's phenotype."
