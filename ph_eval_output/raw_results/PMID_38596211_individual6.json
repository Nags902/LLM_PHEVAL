      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with multiple key features associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 1, including plexiform neurofibroma, freckling, multiple cafe-au-lait spots, scoliosis, and glioma, all of which are directly aligned with the typical clinical profile for this genetic condition."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The presence of glioma in addition to the classic features of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 further supports this diagnosis, indicating a specific manifestation of the disease."

      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis Type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:101000",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "While primarily associated with bilateral vestibular schwannomas, some overlapping features with other types of neurofibromatosis include freckling and neuromas; however, the classic presentation of the patient more closely aligns with Type 1."
