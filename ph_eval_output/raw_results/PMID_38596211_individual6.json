      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Patient meets multiple diagnostic criteria for NF1 including multiple cafe-au-lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling, plexiform neurofibroma, and glioma. The phenotype matches perfectly with all three reference cases."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:162260",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "A variant form of neurofibromatosis that can present with cafe-au-lait spots and neurofibromas, though typically has later onset and lacks optic pathway gliomas."

      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Presents with cafe-au-lait spots and freckling similar to NF1, but typically lacks neurofibromas and gliomas, making it less likely given the patient's plexiform neurofibroma and glioma."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:276300",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Can present with cafe-au-lait spots and brain tumors including gliomas, but neurofibromas are not typical features, and the overall phenotype is less consistent."

      "disease_name": "McCune-Albright syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Features cafe-au-lait spots and can have skeletal abnormalities, but the spots typically have irregular borders, and neurofibromas/gliomas are not characteristic features."
