      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "All presented phenotypic features, including plexiform neurofibroma, axillary and inguinal freckling, multiple cafe-au-lait spots, scoliosis, and glioma (often optic pathway glioma), are classic diagnostic criteria and common manifestations of Neurofibromatosis Type 1. The combination of these specific features provides a near-definitive diagnosis for NF1."

      "disease_name": "Legius Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611490",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome is a differential diagnosis for NF1, characterized by multiple cafe-au-lait spots and freckling (axillary/inguinal). However, it typically lacks neurofibromas (including plexiform neurofibromas) and optic pathway gliomas. The presence of a plexiform neurofibroma and glioma in the patient makes Legius syndrome a much less likely diagnosis compared to NF1."

      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (formerly LEOPARD Syndrome) can present with cafe-au-lait spots. However, its characteristic skin finding is lentigines, not the axillary/inguinal freckling typically seen in NF1. Furthermore, neurofibromas are not a feature, and while some tumors can be associated with Noonan spectrum disorders, the specific combination of features seen in this patient is not typical."

      "disease_name": "Constitutional Mismatch Repair Deficiency Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:276300",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Constitutional Mismatch Repair Deficiency (CMMRD) syndrome can present with multiple cafe-au-lait spots and an increased risk of various cancers, including brain tumors (gliomas). However, the highly specific features of plexiform neurofibroma and axillary/inguinal freckling are not characteristic of CMMRD, making it a much less probable diagnosis compared to NF1, which accounts for all features comprehensively."
