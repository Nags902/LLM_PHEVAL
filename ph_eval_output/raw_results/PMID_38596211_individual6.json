      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits multiple hallmark features of Neurofibromatosis type 1, including plexiform neurofibroma, axillary and inguinal freckling, multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and glioma. Scoliosis is also commonly associated with this condition."

    {
      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome shares some features with Neurofibromatosis type 1, such as cafe-au-lait spots and axillary freckling, but typically lacks tumors like neurofibromas and gliomas. The presence of these tumors makes this less likely."
    },

      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601321",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This syndrome combines features of Neurofibromatosis and Noonan syndrome. While the patient has features of Neurofibromatosis, the absence of Noonan syndrome traits (e.g., short stature, heart defects) makes this less likely."

    {
      "disease_name": "McCune-Albright syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "McCune-Albright syndrome can present with cafe-au-lait spots and scoliosis, but it is typically associated with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and endocrine abnormalities, which are not mentioned here."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This condition includes freckling and cafe-au-lait spots, but it is also characterized by cardiac abnormalities and facial dysmorphisms, which are not noted in the patient's features."
