      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features such as global developmental delay, intellectual disability, absent speech, motor delay, autistic behavior, motor stereotypy, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, and facial features (epicanthus, high forehead, depressed nasal bridge, high palate) are highly suggestive of Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Features like thickened nuchal skin fold, strabismus, nystagmus, ventricular septal defect, and facial hypotonia are seen in Noonan Syndrome, though the absence of key features like webbed neck and cardiac anomalies other than VSD makes it less likely."
