      "disease_id": "OMIM:236200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with Arachnodactyly, Intellectual disability, Disproportionate tall stature, and Hyperhomocystinemia, which are hallmark features of Homocystinuria. The similar reference case (Case 1) also had Hyperhomocystinemia, Intellectual disability, and Arachnodactyly, leading to a diagnosis of Homocystinuria."

      "disease_name": "Marfan syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:154700",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Marfan syndrome is characterized by Arachnodactyly and Disproportionate tall stature, but it typically does not include Intellectual disability or Hyperhomocystinemia. However, the presence of Arachnodactyly and tall stature makes it a possible, though less likely, diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Sotos syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:117550",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Sotos syndrome is associated with tall stature and Intellectual disability, but it does not typically include Arachnodactyly or Hyperhomocystinemia. The similar reference case (Case 3) had tall stature and Intellectual disability, but the other features do not align as well."

      "disease_name": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:609192",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome can present with Arachnodactyly and tall stature, but Intellectual disability and Hyperhomocystinemia are not typical features. This makes it a less likely diagnosis compared to Homocystinuria."
