      "explanation": "The patient's features of hypoparathyroidism, thymic aplasia/hypoplasia, and T lymphocytopenia are classic hallmarks of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which is the most likely diagnosis."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "CHARGE syndrome can present with thymic hypoplasia and T-cell deficiency, though hypoparathyroidism is less common. The combination of features makes it a possible but less likely diagnosis."

      "explanation": "APS-1 can cause hypoparathyroidism and immune dysfunction, but thymic aplasia is not a typical feature. The presence of thymic aplasia makes this less likely."
