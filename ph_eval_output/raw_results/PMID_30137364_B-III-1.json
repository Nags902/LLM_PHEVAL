      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The presence of hypoparathyroidism, aplasia/hypoplasia of the thymus, and T lymphocytopenia strongly suggests DiGeorge syndrome, which is characterized by these features as well as other findings in similar reference cases."

      "disease_name": "CHARGE syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:214800",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "CHARGE syndrome can present with hypoparathyroidism and immune deficiencies similar to those found in DiGeorge syndrome. However, it is less consistent with the clinical presentation as other features commonly found in CHARGE syndrome are not listed."

      "disease_name": "22q11.2 deletion syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611867",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which encompasses DiGeorge syndrome, matches the clinical findings of hypoparathyroidism, thymic hypoplasia, and T lymphocytopenia. It is ranked lower due to the likelihood being encompassed by DiGeorge syndrome itself."
