      "disease_name": "Retinitis Pigmentosa",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:268000",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Retinitis Pigmentosa is a group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive peripheral vision loss and night vision difficulties, often leading to central vision loss. The presence of reduced visual acuity, retinal pigment epithelial mottling, and abnormal electroretinogram are hallmark features of this condition."

    {
      "disease_name": "Stargardt Disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:248200",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Stargardt Disease is a form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration that leads to progressive vision loss. The retinal pigment epithelial mottling and abnormal electroretinogram are consistent with this condition, though it typically presents in childhood or adolescence."

    {
      "disease_name": "Cone-Rod Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:120970",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Cone-Rod Dystrophy is a group of inherited ocular disorders characterized by retinal degeneration, leading to visual impairment. The abnormal electroretinogram and reduced visual acuity are common findings, though retinal pigment epithelial mottling may be less prominent."

    {
      "disease_name": "Choroideremia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:303100",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Choroideremia is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, and retina. The reduced visual acuity and retinal pigment epithelial mottling are consistent with this condition, though it typically affects males more severely."

    {
      "disease_name": "Best Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:153700",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Best Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder leading to macular degeneration. The retinal pigment epithelial mottling and reduced visual acuity can occur, but the abnormal electroretinogram is less commonly associated."
