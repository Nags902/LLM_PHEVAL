      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Patient presents with all three core features seen in RP11 from Case 2: reduced visual acuity, abnormal ERG, and retinal pigment epithelial changes. Age of presentation (26Y) is consistent with typical RP onset."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Shows 3/4 features from Case 1 (reduced visual acuity, abnormal ERG, retinal pigment epithelial mottling). However, lacks nystagmus and severe visual reduction, and LCA typically presents in infancy, not at 26 years."

      "explanation": "Characterized by retinal pigment epithelial mottling and mild visual acuity reduction. ERG is often normal but can show mild abnormalities. Adult onset fits patient's age."
