      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features \u2013 including neurofibroma, axillary freckling, inguinal freckling, multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and Lisch nodules \u2013 directly fulfill multiple diagnostic criteria for Neurofibromatosis, type 1 (NF1). This comprehensive constellation of symptoms strongly indicates NF1 as the primary diagnosis. All provided reference cases with highly similar presentations were also diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis, type 1, further supporting this conclusion."

      "disease_name": "Legius Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611490",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius Syndrome is considered in the differential diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis, type 1, as it also presents with features like multiple cafe-au-lait spots and freckling. However, it is significantly less likely in this patient because Legius Syndrome typically lacks neurofibromas and Lisch nodules, both of which are present in the patient's phenotype. It is included as a low-confidence differential diagnosis due to some shared features and its place in the clinical pathway for NF1-like syndromes."
