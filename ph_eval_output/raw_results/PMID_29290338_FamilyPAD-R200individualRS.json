      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The presence of neurofibromas, axillary freckling, multiple cafe-au-lait spots, inguinal freckling, and Lisch nodules are classical features that strongly suggest Neurofibromatosis, type 1, as documented in similar reference cases."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:101000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While the phenotype is more indicative of type 1, Neurofibromatosis type 2 can present with neurofibromas; however, it typically includes bilateral vestibular schwannomas which were not reported here."

      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome can present with cafe-au-lait spots and freckling but does not typically include neurofibromas or Lisch nodules, making it a less likely, although possible, differential diagnosis."
