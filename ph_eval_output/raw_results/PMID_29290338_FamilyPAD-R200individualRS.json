      "explanation": "All phenotypic features match the classic presentation of Neurofibromatosis type 1, including neurofibromas, axillary and inguinal freckling, multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and Lisch nodules. This diagnosis is supported by the similarity to multiple reference cases."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:162210",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similar presentation to Neurofibromatosis type 1 but typically affects only a segment of the body. Consideration is due to the presence of key features, though the widespread distribution in this case suggests type 1 is more likely."
