      "explanation": "The combination of neurofibroma, axillary and inguinal freckling, multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and Lisch nodules is highly characteristic of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). This autosomal dominant disorder is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which align perfectly with the patient's phenotypic features."
