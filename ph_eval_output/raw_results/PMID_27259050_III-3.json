      "disease_name": "Fanconi anemia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:227650",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Fanconi anemia is a genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, pancytopenia, and various physical abnormalities. The patient's bone marrow hypocellularity, pancytopenia, and anemia are highly suggestive of this condition."

      "disease_name": "Dyskeratosis congenita",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:305000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare genetic disorder that can present with bone marrow failure, pancytopenia, and neurological symptoms. The patient's pancytopenia and neurological features (unsteady gait, nystagmus, dysarthria, dysmetria) could be indicative of this condition."

      "disease_name": "Ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:159550",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome is characterized by pancytopenia and neurological symptoms such as ataxia and nystagmus. The patient's pancytopenia and neurological features align with this syndrome."

      "disease_name": "Pearson syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:557000",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Pearson syndrome is a mitochondrial disorder that can cause bone marrow failure, pancytopenia, and neurological symptoms. The patient's bone marrow hypocellularity and pancytopenia could be consistent with this syndrome."

    {
      "disease_name": "Shwachman-Diamond syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:260400",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is a genetic disorder that can present with bone marrow failure, neutropenia, and other hematological abnormalities. The patient's neutropenia and bone marrow hypocellularity could suggest this condition."
