      "disease_name": "COL4A1-related cerebral small vessel disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607829",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This disorder, caused by mutations in COL4A1, is exceptionally well-aligned with the patient's phenotype. It is strongly associated with cerebral hemorrhage (including perinatal strokes), which can directly lead to the formation of porencephalic cysts. Furthermore, it is characterized by leukoencephalopathy (manifesting as abnormal CNS myelination), hydrocephalus, thin corpus callosum, and can involve basal ganglia calcification. The combination of vascular fragility, destructive brain lesions, and white matter abnormalities makes this the most likely diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:225750",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome (AGS) is a major differential given the presence of prominent basal ganglia calcification and abnormal CNS myelination (often hypomyelination or dysmyelination). This neuroinflammatory disorder frequently presents with hydrocephalus, generalized cerebral atrophy (leading to ventricular dilatation and thin corpus callosum), and gliosis. While cerebral hemorrhage and porencephalic cysts are less classic primary features, they can occur in severe forms due to secondary complications or underlying brain injury, making AGS a strong candidate."

      "disease_name": "Congenital Toxoplasmosis",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:205400",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Congenital infections, particularly Toxoplasmosis, are well-established causes of central nervous system abnormalities that closely resemble several of the patient's features. These include characteristic basal ganglia calcification, hydrocephalus, and destructive brain lesions that can lead to porencephalic cysts. Cerebral hemorrhage and abnormal CNS myelination are also known manifestations. This infectious etiology should be thoroughly investigated, especially given the resemblance to congenital viral encephalopathies."

    {
      "disease_name": "Leigh Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:256000",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Leigh Syndrome, a severe mitochondrial encephalopathy, is a consideration due to its common involvement of the basal ganglia, sometimes presenting with calcification (though less typical than in AGS). It is also characterized by progressive leukoencephalopathy (abnormal CNS myelination), gliosis, and cerebral atrophy with ventricular dilatation. While cerebral hemorrhage and porencephalic cysts are not primary features, severe metabolic crises associated with Leigh Syndrome can lead to acute brain lesions resembling strokes."
