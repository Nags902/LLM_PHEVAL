      "disease_name": "Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:310300",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms, including proximal muscle weakness, joint contractures (elbow and Achilles tendon), spinal rigidity, scapuloperoneal amyotrophy, and cardiac involvement (ventricular arrhythmia and abnormal left ventricular function), are highly suggestive of Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy."

      "disease_name": "Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:159000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient's proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase, and loss of ambulation are consistent with Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy, though the joint contractures and cardiac involvement are more typical of Emery-Dreifuss."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Becker Muscular Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300376",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms overlap with Becker Muscular Dystrophy, including elevated creatine kinase and proximal muscle weakness, but the joint contractures and scapuloperoneal involvement are less common in this condition."

    {
      "disease_name": "Myotonic Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:160900",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Myotonic Dystrophy can present with muscle weakness and cardiac issues, but the joint contractures and scapuloperoneal amyotrophy are less characteristic of this disease."

    {
      "disease_name": "Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:158900",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "While scapuloperoneal amyotrophy and proximal weakness can occur in FSHD, the joint contractures and cardiac involvement are not typical features."
