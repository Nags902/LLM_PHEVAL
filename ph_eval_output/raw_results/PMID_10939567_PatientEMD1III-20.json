      "disease_id": "OMIM:181350",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms, including difficulty running, waddling gait, loss of ambulation, Achilles tendon contracture, elbow contracture, spinal rigidity, elevated creatine kinase, ventricular arrhythmia, abnormal left ventricular function, scapuloperoneal amyotrophy, proximal muscle weakness in upper limbs, and stiff neck, closely match the phenotypic features of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 2. The similar reference cases also support this diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:603511",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy can present with proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase, and loss of ambulation, but the presence of contractures and cardiac involvement makes it less likely than Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:300376",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Becker muscular dystrophy can present with elevated creatine kinase, proximal muscle weakness, and cardiac involvement, but the presence of contractures and scapuloperoneal amyotrophy is more indicative of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy."

      "explanation": "Myotonic dystrophy type 1 can present with muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and elevated creatine kinase, but the presence of contractures and scapuloperoneal amyotrophy is less typical for this condition."
