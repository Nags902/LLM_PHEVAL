    {
      "disease_name": "Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 2, autosomal dominant",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:181350",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The phenotypic features align closely with those reported in similar reference cases diagnosed with this condition, including achilles tendon contracture, elbow contracture, spinal rigidity, elevated creatine kinase, and abnormal left ventricular function."

    {
      "disease_name": "Bethlem Myopathy 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:158810",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Bethlem Myopathy can cause muscle weakness, contractures, and elevated creatine kinase, which align with the patient's symptoms of proximal muscle weakness and joint contractures. However, cardiac manifestations are less typical, lowering the rank."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 1B",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:159001",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "This condition can present with elevated creatine kinase, muscle weakness, and cardiac involvement, including arrhythmias. However, it lacks some of the specific contractures and the stiff neck reported in the patient, making it less aligned."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Collagen VI-related myopathy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:254130",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Collagen VI-related myopathy involves muscle weakness and contractures, like in this case. However, the presence of ventricular arrhythmias and specific cardiac features is less common, which decreases its ranking."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:310200",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "While encompassing muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is less consistent with the adult onset and cardiac-specific features, resulting in a lower rank."
