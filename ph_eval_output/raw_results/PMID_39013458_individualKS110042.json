      "disease_name": "Sotos Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:117550",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Sotos Syndrome 1 is characterized by tall stature, hypotonia, intellectual disability, and developmental delay, all of which match the patient's primary features. Although recurrent infections and hypermetropia are not classic features, the core characteristics are highly indicative of Sotos Syndrome 1."

      "disease_name": "Kostmann Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:610738",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Kostmann Syndrome often presents with recurrent infections due to severe neutropenia, and can include developmental delays and constipation. While it does not typically include tall stature or hypermetropia, the recurrent infections align with the patient's symptoms, making it a potential consideration."

      "disease_name": "Marfan Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:154700",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Marfan Syndrome is associated with tall stature and can include hypotonia. However, it is less commonly associated with intellectual disability or recurrent infections. Despite this, the overlap in some symptoms requires consideration."

      "disease_name": "Fragile X Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300624",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Fragile X Syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability and developmental delay. It may also present with hypotonia, but it is not typically associated with tall stature or recurrent infections, reducing its likelihood."

      "disease_name": "Chromosome 16p11.2 Deletion Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611913",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Chromosome 16p11.2 Deletion Syndrome can present with developmental delay, hypotonia, and intellectual disability. While not directly associated with tall stature or hypermetropia, the broad range of symptoms makes it a potential candidate."
