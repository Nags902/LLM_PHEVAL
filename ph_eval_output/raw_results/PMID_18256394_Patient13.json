      "disease_name": "Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:176670",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with nearly all cardinal features of HGPS including proptosis, lipodystrophy, alopecia, micrognathia, short stature, failure to thrive, prominent superficial blood vessels, reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue, and dental abnormalities. The reference cases with identical diagnosis share these features. The prolonged QT interval also matches the cardiac involvement typical in progeria."

      "disease_name": "Mandibuloacral Dysplasia with Type A Lipodystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:248370",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "MAD type A shares many features including lipodystrophy, micrognathia, alopecia, short stature, reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue, and dental abnormalities. However, it typically lacks the severe vascular changes and prominent proptosis seen in this patient."

      "disease_name": "Atypical Werner Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:277700",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Werner syndrome can present with premature aging features including alopecia, lipodystrophy, short stature, and reduced bone density. However, it typically manifests later in life and lacks the characteristic facial features like proptosis and micrognathia seen in this patient."

      "disease_name": "Restrictive Dermopathy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:275210",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "RD shares some features like micrognathia and failure to thrive, but typically presents with severe skin abnormalities at birth and is usually lethal in infancy. The patient's age and specific phenotype make this less likely."

      "disease_name": "Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy Type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:608594",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "BSCL can present with lipodystrophy and prominent superficial vessels, but typically lacks the progeria-like features such as alopecia, micrognathia, and dental abnormalities. The cardiac involvement pattern also differs."
