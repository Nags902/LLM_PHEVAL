      "disease_name": "Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I, Hurler Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607014",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This is the most probable diagnosis due to the classic presentation of severe dysostosis multiplex (including beaking of vertebral bodies, platyspondyly, short metacarpals/metatarsals, carpal bone hypoplasia, hypoplastic iliac wing, flat acetabular roof, genu valgum, lumbar hyperlordosis, scoliosis, rhizomelia), prominent coarse facial features, short neck, waddling gait, and profound intellectual disability with absent speech. These features are highly characteristic of Hurler Syndrome, the most severe form of MPS I."

    {
      "disease_name": "Mucolipidosis II alpha/beta",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:252500",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Mucolipidosis II (I-cell disease) presents with a phenotype strikingly similar to severe Hurler Syndrome. It encompasses severe dysostosis multiplex, coarse facial features, and profound intellectual disability, making it a very strong differential diagnosis that aligns well with the patient's comprehensive set of symptoms."

    {
      "disease_name": "Alpha-Mannosidosis",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:248500",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Alpha-Mannosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder that causes a constellation of symptoms including dysostosis multiplex, coarse facial features, intellectual disability, and waddling gait. The presence of 'fine hair' in the patient, while not exclusive, is sometimes reported in alpha-mannosidosis, making it a potentially better fit for this specific detail compared to the typically coarse hair in MPS I/II."

    {
      "disease_name": "Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II, severe form (Hunter Syndrome)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:309900",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Hunter Syndrome (MPS II) shares significant phenotypic overlap with Hurler Syndrome, including dysostosis multiplex, coarse facial features, and progressive intellectual disability in its severe form. It presents as a strong differential diagnosis given the patient's comprehensive set of skeletal, facial, and neurological symptoms."

    {
      "disease_name": "GM1 Gangliosidosis Type 2 (Juvenile)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:230500",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "GM1 Gangliosidosis Type 2 is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by progressive neurological deterioration (intellectual disability, absent speech), dysostosis multiplex, and coarse facial features. While Type 1 is an infantile and more severe form, Type 2 presents later and fits the skeletal and neurological progression observed in the patient."
