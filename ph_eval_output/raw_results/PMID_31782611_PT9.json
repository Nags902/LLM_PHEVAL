      "score": 1.0,

      "disease_id": "OMIM:616999",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This disorder, exemplified by reference Case 3 (TBCK-related), directly matches Microcephaly, Intellectual disability, and Delayed speech and language development. While hypotonia is a key feature of this specific disease and not explicitly stated for the patient, delayed gross motor development often accompanies hypotonia, making it a strong candidate."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:300958",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Based on reference Case 2, this disease presents with Intellectual disability, Delayed speech and language development, and Motor delay (similar to gross motor delay). While the reference case notes Macrocephaly and the patient has Microcephaly, X-linked intellectual disabilities can exhibit variable head circumference, making it a plausible consideration consistent with the patient's male gender."
