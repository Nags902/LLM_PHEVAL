      "disease_name": "22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:188400",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This syndrome is highly associated with cleft palate (including velopharyngeal insufficiency), intellectual disability (typically mild to moderate), and global developmental delay. All three reported phenotypic features are common and hallmark manifestations of 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome, making it the most consistent and likely diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:270400",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome is characterized by universal intellectual disability and global developmental delay. Cleft palate is a significant and frequent finding, occurring in approximately 50% of affected individuals, which aligns well with the patient's presented features."

    {
      "disease_name": "Opitz G/BBB Syndrome, X-linked",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300000",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Opitz G/BBB Syndrome commonly presents with midline defects, including cleft palate. Intellectual disability and global developmental delay are also variable but recognized features, making it a plausible candidate for the observed combination of symptoms."

    {
      "disease_name": "Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:194190",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome is characterized by severe intellectual disability and global developmental delay. Cleft lip and/or palate is also reported in a significant proportion (30-50%) of cases, making it a relevant differential diagnosis."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "CHARGE Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:214800",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "CHARGE Syndrome consistently involves intellectual disability and global developmental delay. While not as frequent as in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome, cleft palate can occur in about 15-20% of cases. The presence of the neurodevelopmental and palatal features makes it a possible, albeit less specific, consideration."
