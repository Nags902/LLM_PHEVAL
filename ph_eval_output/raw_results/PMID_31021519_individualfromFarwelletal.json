      "disease_name": "22q11.2 deletion syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:188400",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "22q11.2 deletion syndrome can present with cleft palate, intellectual disability, and developmental delay. It is a common genetic disorder with overlapping features to the presented phenotypes."

      "disease_name": "CHARGE syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:214800",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Although CHARGE syndrome frequently involves additional features like coloboma and heart defects, the main features of cleft palate and developmental delays present a possible, though less likely, match."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:119300",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Primarily associated with cleft palate, Van der Woude syndrome could be considered, albeit typically without intellectual disability and developmental delay."
