      "disease_id": "OMIM:213300",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Joubert Syndrome 1 is characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia, ocular motor apraxia (which could contribute to strabismus), developmental delay, and intellectual disability. The combination of these features along with sensorineural hearing impairment suggests a strong match."

      "disease_name": "COACH Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:216360",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "COACH Syndrome, a subtype of Joubert syndrome-related disorders, includes cerebellar hypoplasia, intellectual disability, and ocular motility issues like strabismus. The overlap of these symptoms with the patient's features makes it a probable candidate."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:610688",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "Ponto-Cerebellar Hypoplasia Type 6 involves microcephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. The combination of these neurological features aligns with the patient's symptoms."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:276933",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Also known as Warburg Micro syndrome, this condition includes microcephaly, intellectual disability, and sensorineural hearing loss. The co-occurrence of these features with developmental delays supports its ranking."
