      "explanation": "The patient's features closely match this disorder, including cerebellar hypoplasia, delayed speech and language development, motor delay, strabismus, and intellectual disability."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:619090",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient shares several features with this disorder, such as microcephaly, intellectual disability, delayed speech and language development, and cerebellar hypoplasia, though optic atrophy is not noted in the patient."

      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits some overlapping features like intellectual disability, delayed speech and language development, strabismus, and microcephaly, but lacks seizures which are common in this disorder."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:213300",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "The patient's cerebellar hypoplasia, intellectual disability, and delayed motor development are consistent with Joubert syndrome, but other hallmark features like the molar tooth sign are not mentioned."

      "disease_name": "Pontocerebellar hypoplasia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607596",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "The patient's cerebellar hypoplasia, microcephaly, and developmental delays align with this disorder, though specific subtypes would need further investigation."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:105830",
      "score": 0.166,
      "explanation": "The patient's intellectual disability, delayed speech, and motor delays are seen in Angelman syndrome, but the absence of a happy demeanor and frequent laughter makes this less likely."

      "disease_name": "Rett syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312750",
      "score": 0.142,
      "explanation": "The patient's microcephaly, intellectual disability, and delayed speech could suggest Rett syndrome, but the lack of regression and hand stereotypies reduces the likelihood."
