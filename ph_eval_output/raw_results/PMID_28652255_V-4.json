      "disease_name": "Neuroacanthocytosis Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:609242",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Neuroacanthocytosis is characterized by movement disorders including ataxia and chorea or athetosis, with signs like dysarthria and supranuclear gaze palsy. Hypoalbuminemia can occur due to nutritional issues secondary to neurologic symptoms."

      "disease_name": "Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:257220",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Niemann-Pick Disease Type C1 can present with ataxia, supranuclear gaze palsy, and dysarthria. Hypoalbuminemia may occur due to liver involvement. The combination of neurological symptoms is suggestive."

      "disease_name": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia, Type 3 (Machado-Joseph Disease)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:109150",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 presents with ataxia, dysarthria, and potentially hyporeflexia. Though supranuclear gaze palsy is less common, the pattern fits a progressive neurodegenerative disease."

      "disease_name": "Wilson Disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:277900",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Wilson Disease may include neurological features such as ataxia and dysarthria, and liver dysfunction could lead to hypoalbuminemia. Supranuclear gaze palsy and athetosis can occasionally be seen."

    {
      "disease_name": "Friedreich Ataxia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:229300",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Friedreich Ataxia typically presents with ataxia, dysarthria, and hyporeflexia, though it is less commonly associated with the full set of presented symptoms such as hypoalbuminemia and supranuclear gaze palsy."
