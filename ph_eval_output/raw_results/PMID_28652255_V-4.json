      "disease_id": "OMIM:208920",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features match those of Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1, including ataxia, hyporeflexia, supranuclear gaze palsy, dysarthria, athetosis, and hypoalbuminemia. This diagnosis is consistent with the reference cases."

      "disease_name": "Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:606002",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This type of ataxia also presents with hypoalbuminemia and similar neurological symptoms such as ataxia and dysarthria, although the gaze palsy might not be as prominent. It is still a plausible consideration given the overlap in features."

      "disease_name": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:183090",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 can present with similar symptoms, including ataxia and dysarthria. However, supranuclear gaze palsy and athetosis are less characteristic, making it a less likely match despite the overlap."
