      "disease_id": "OMIM:278700",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Xeroderma Pigmentosum is characterized by freckling due to sensitivity to ultraviolet light, making it the most likely candidate related to this phenotype."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:175200",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome is associated with freckling, particularly around the lips and mucous membranes, which aligns with the presenting feature."

      "disease_name": "LEOPARD Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "LEOPARD Syndrome features include multiple lentigines (similar to freckles), contributing to its lower likelihood relative to other diseases considered."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:153480",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "The condition can present with pigmented macules, including freckle-like features, although it is less closely aligned than the more likely conditions."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome can have overlapping features with LEOPARD Syndrome, though freckling is not as specific, leading to its lower rank."
