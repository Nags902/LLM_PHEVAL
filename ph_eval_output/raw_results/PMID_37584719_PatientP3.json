      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "All three reference cases with similar phenotypes (autoimmune hemolytic anemia and chronic diarrhea) were diagnosed with this condition. The patient's age and gender (male) are consistent with X-linked inheritance pattern."

      "explanation": "Can present with chronic diarrhea and autoimmune cytopenias including hemolytic anemia. However, typically presents later in life and lacks the full spectrum seen in reference cases."

      "explanation": "X-linked disorder that can present with inflammatory bowel disease-like symptoms and cytopenias. The specific combination of chronic diarrhea and autoimmune hemolytic anemia is possible but less characteristic."
