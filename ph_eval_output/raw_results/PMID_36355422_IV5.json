      "disease_name": "Deafness, autosomal recessive 124",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:614614",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This disease is the top-ranked choice because two out of three provided similar reference cases presented with isolated sensorineural hearing impairment and were subsequently diagnosed with Deafness, autosomal recessive 124. This direct match makes it the most probable cause given the available data."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Deafness, autosomal recessive 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:220290",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Deafness, autosomal recessive 1 (DFNB1), primarily caused by mutations in GJB2, is the most common cause of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing impairment worldwide. Its high prevalence makes it a strong candidate for any patient presenting with isolated sensorineural hearing impairment, despite not being directly featured in the provided similar cases."

    {
      "disease_name": "Deafness, autosomal recessive 4",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:600791",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Deafness, autosomal recessive 4 (DFNB4), caused by mutations in SLC26A4, is another common cause of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing impairment, often associated with an enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA). It is a well-known genetic etiology for isolated SNHL and thus warrants consideration."

    {
      "disease_name": "Deafness, autosomal recessive 9",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601072",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Deafness, autosomal recessive 9 (DFNB9), caused by mutations in OTOF, is a significant cause of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing impairment, particularly auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder. Given the patient's phenotype, it is a highly relevant differential diagnosis for isolated SNHL."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Deafness, autosomal recessive 15",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601892",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This disease was observed in one of the similar reference cases (Case 3) which presented with sensorineural hearing impairment, though that case also included additional features (abnormal vestibular function, visual impairment). While the patient only presents with SNHL, this disease is a known cause and should be considered, especially if further investigation reveals additional subtle features."
