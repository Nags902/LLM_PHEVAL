      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This syndrome includes features like colobomas, hearing loss, and craniofacial anomalies, which align with the presented symptoms, but the presence of aplasia cutis congenita raises some concerns regarding direct correlation."

      "explanation": "This condition can present with microphthalmia and cleft lip/palate, but the broader range of phenotypic features does not fully match; however, it remains a consideration due to overlapping ocular and craniofacial defects."
