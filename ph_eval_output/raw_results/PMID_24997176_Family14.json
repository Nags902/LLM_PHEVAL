      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features closely match those of the similar reference cases, all of which were diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis 6. The presence of nystagmus, very low visual acuity, eye poking, and hypermetropia strongly suggests this diagnosis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:204000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Leber congenital amaurosis 1 shares many features with LCA6, including nystagmus and very low visual acuity. However, the reference cases point more strongly towards LCA6."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:204100",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Another subtype of Leber congenital amaurosis, LCA2 also presents with similar symptoms, but the reference cases and specific phenotypic alignment make LCA6 more likely."

      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Achromatopsia can present with nystagmus and low visual acuity, but the presence of eye poking and hypermetropia is more characteristic of Leber congenital amaurosis."

      "disease_name": "Joubert syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:213300",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Joubert syndrome can include nystagmus and visual impairment, but typically involves additional neurological features not present in this case."
