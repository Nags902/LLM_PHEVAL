      "score": 1.0,

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Classic LCA presentation with severe visual impairment from infancy, nystagmus, and eye poking (oculodigital sign). LCA1 is caused by GUCY2D mutations and presents similarly to LCA6."

      "explanation": "RPE65-related LCA presenting with severe early-onset retinal dystrophy, nystagmus, and characteristic eye poking behavior. Hypermetropia is common in LCA2."

      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "CEP290-related LCA is the most common form, presenting with severe visual impairment, nystagmus, and oculodigital sign. Matches core phenotype but less specific than LCA6 given reference cases."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "CNGA3-related achromatopsia presents with nystagmus, severely reduced visual acuity, and hypermetropia. However, typically has better visual function than LCA and lacks eye poking."

      "explanation": "Can present with nystagmus, reduced visual acuity, and hypermetropia. However, eye poking is not typical, and usually has characteristic hypopigmentation features not mentioned."
