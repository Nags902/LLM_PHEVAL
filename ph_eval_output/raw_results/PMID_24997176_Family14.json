      "disease_name": "Leber Congenital Amaurosis 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:204000",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is a rare inherited eye disorder that primarily affects the retina, leading to severe vision loss from birth. The patient's symptoms of nystagmus, very low visual acuity, and eye poking are classic features of LCA. Hypermetropia can also be associated with this condition due to the retinal dysfunction."

    {
      "disease_name": "Joubert Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:213300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Joubert Syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal brain development, which can include nystagmus and very low visual acuity. Eye poking and hypermetropia are less common but can occur due to the associated retinal dystrophy or optic nerve abnormalities."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Achromatopsia 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:216900",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Achromatopsia is a condition that affects the retina, leading to severe visual impairment, nystagmus, and photophobia. While eye poking is not a typical feature, the other symptoms align well with this diagnosis. Hypermetropia can be a secondary feature due to the retinal dysfunction."

      "disease_name": "Bardet-Biedl Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:209900",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Bardet-Biedl Syndrome is a ciliopathy that can present with retinal dystrophy, leading to very low visual acuity and nystagmus. Eye poking and hypermetropia are less common but can occur due to the retinal involvement. Other systemic features would typically be present but may not yet be apparent in a young patient."

    {
      "disease_name": "Alstrom Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:203800",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Alstrom Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that includes retinal dystrophy, leading to nystagmus and very low visual acuity. Eye poking and hypermetropia can occur, but this syndrome typically includes other systemic features such as hearing loss and obesity, which may not yet be evident in a young patient."
