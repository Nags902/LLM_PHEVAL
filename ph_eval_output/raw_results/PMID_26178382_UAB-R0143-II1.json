      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is the most common neurocutaneous disorder characterized by multiple cafe-au-lait spots and axillary or inguinal freckling (Crowe's sign), which are two cardinal diagnostic criteria. Given the patient's age and the presence of both features, NF1 is the leading candidate."

      "disease_name": "Legius Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611490",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius Syndrome, caused by SPRED1 mutations, presents with clinical features highly overlapping with NF1, specifically multiple cafe-au-lait spots and freckling. It is considered an NF1-like syndrome and is a crucial differential diagnosis when these skin findings are the primary features, particularly in the absence of other NF1-specific manifestations."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines, also known as LEOPARD Syndrome (e.g., LEOPARD Syndrome type 1 caused by PTPN11, LEOPARD Syndrome type 2 caused by RAF1, LEOPARD Syndrome type 3 caused by BRAF), is characterized by numerous lentigines, which can clinically resemble freckles, and may also include cafe-au-lait spots. The combination of freckling/lentigines and cafe-au-lait spots makes it a strong consideration, although other Noonan syndrome features may also be present."
