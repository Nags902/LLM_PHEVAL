      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "All three reference cases with this diagnosis share the core features seen in this patient: infantile spasms, focal tonic seizures, EEG with generalized slow activity, generalized hypotonia, global developmental delay, and hypsarrhythmia. The patient's phenotype closely matches the reference cases."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Classic triad of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia on EEG, and developmental delay/regression is present. However, the presence of focal seizures and specific EEG findings suggest a more specific epileptic encephalopathy."
