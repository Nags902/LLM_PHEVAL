      "disease_id": "OMIM:613254",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This is the most likely diagnosis. The patient presents with a classic triad of phenotypic features: cortical tubers, angiofibromas (typically facial angiofibromas), and renal angiomyolipoma. These three features are hallmark manifestations of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2, caused by mutations in the TSC2 gene, is the more common genetic cause of TSC and is often associated with a more severe phenotype, making it a strong primary candidate."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:191100",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1, caused by mutations in the TSC1 gene, presents with an identical spectrum of clinical features as TSC2, including cortical tubers, angiofibromas, and renal angiomyolipoma. While generally considered to have a milder phenotype on average and accounting for a smaller percentage of TSC cases compared to TSC2, it remains a highly probable diagnosis given the patient's specific symptoms. Without genetic testing, distinguishing between TSC1 and TSC2 purely on phenotype is not possible."

      "disease_name": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Sporadic",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:606689",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "This is a very distant and low-confidence differential diagnosis. While sporadic Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) can cause renal angiomyolipomas, it typically manifests with progressive cystic lung destruction and does not explain the presence of cortical tubers or facial angiofibromas. Its consideration is primarily due to the shared feature of renal angiomyolipoma; however, in the context of the full clinical picture, it is far less likely than Tuberous Sclerosis Complex."
