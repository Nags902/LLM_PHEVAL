      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and a shortened QT interval, which are key features of Short QT syndrome 3. Similar reference cases with the same phenotype were diagnosed with this condition."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:609620",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While Short QT syndrome 1 shares the main features of a shortened QT interval and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, it is less commonly associated compared to Short QT syndrome 3. However, it remains a plausible candidate given similar phenotypic manifestations."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:609621",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Although less frequently reported in similar reference cases, Short QT syndrome 2 is another subtype of Short QT syndrome that presents with a shortened QT interval and could potentially account for the observed cardiac features."
