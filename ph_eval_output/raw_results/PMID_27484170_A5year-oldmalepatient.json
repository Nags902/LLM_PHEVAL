      "explanation": "Patient presents with multiple lentigines, short stature, hypertelorism, and pulmonic stenosis - all cardinal features of LEOPARD syndrome. The reference cases show identical phenotypes. LEOPARD is an acronym for Lentigines, ECG abnormalities, Ocular hypertelorism, Pulmonic stenosis, Abnormal genitalia, Retardation of growth, and Deafness."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Caused by RAF1 mutations, presents with similar features to LEOPARD syndrome 1 including multiple lentigines, hypertelorism, short stature, and cardiac defects. Less common than type 1 but should be considered."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Caused by BRAF mutations, presents with overlapping features including lentigines, cardiac defects, and facial dysmorphism. Rarer form but phenotypically similar to types 1 and 2."

      "explanation": "Patient has few cafe-au-lait spots which is a feature of NF1, and reference case 3 shows NF1 with pulmonic stenosis. However, multiple lentigines and hypertelorism are not typical of NF1, making it less likely."
