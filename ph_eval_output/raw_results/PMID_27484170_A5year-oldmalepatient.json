      "explanation": "LEOPARD syndrome (Lentigines, ECG abnormalities, Ocular hypertelorism, Pulmonary stenosis, Abnormalities of genitalia, Retardation of growth, Deafness) perfectly matches the patient's presentation with multiple lentigines, hypertelorism, pulmonic stenosis, and short stature. The presence of cafe-au-lait spots is also consistent."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Shares several features including pulmonic stenosis, short stature, and hypertelorism. However, multiple lentigines are not typical of classic Noonan syndrome, making it less likely than LEOPARD syndrome."

      "explanation": "The presence of cafe-au-lait spots suggests this condition, but the combination of pulmonic stenosis, hypertelorism, and multiple lentigines is not typical for NF1, making it less likely."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Part of the RASopathy spectrum with cardiac defects, short stature, and distinctive facial features. However, multiple lentigines are not characteristic, and the overall phenotype better fits LEOPARD syndrome."

      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "A variant of NF1 that can present with pulmonic stenosis and cafe-au-lait spots, but multiple lentigines and hypertelorism are not typical features, making it less likely than other diagnoses."
