      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (PTPN11-related)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:151100",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This is the most common genetic cause of LEOPARD syndrome, now often referred to as Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines. It is an excellent match for all presented features: pulmonic stenosis, short stature, hypertelorism, and most notably, multiple lentigines. Few cafe-au-lait spots can also be seen in this condition."

      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (RAF1-related)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611554",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This is another known genetic subtype of LEOPARD syndrome, caused by mutations in RAF1. It presents with highly similar clinical features including pulmonic stenosis, short stature, hypertelorism, and multiple lentigines, making it a strong candidate, though less common than the PTPN11-related form."

      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (BRAF-related)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613707",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "This is a rarer genetic subtype of LEOPARD syndrome, caused by BRAF mutations. It also manifests with similar features, including cardiac anomalies (often hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but pulmonic stenosis can occur), short stature, facial dysmorphism (hypertelorism), and lentigines, fitting the patient's phenotype well."

    {
      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (MAP2K1-related)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:618335",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This is the least common genetic subtype of LEOPARD syndrome identified to date, caused by MAP2K1 mutations. It presents with features consistent with the syndrome, including cardiac findings, short stature, facial dysmorphism (hypertelorism), and lentigines, aligning with the patient's features."

    {
      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome 1 (PTPN11-related)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "While the patient presents with multiple lentigines characteristic of LEOPARD syndrome (a specific Noonan variant), classical Noonan syndrome (particularly due to PTPN11 mutations) shares core features like pulmonic stenosis, short stature, and hypertelorism. This would be a consideration if the lentigines were atypical or subtle, or if the specific LEOPARD-causing mutations were absent."

    {
      "disease_name": "Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:115150",
      "score": 0.16,
      "explanation": "Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome is another RASopathy that shares several features with the patient, including cardiac defects (often pulmonic stenosis), short stature, and hypertelorism. While the specific skin findings (multiple lentigines) are not typical for CFC syndrome, the overall spectrum of RASopathies includes overlapping phenotypes, making it a plausible differential diagnosis."

    {
      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "The presence of 'few cafe-au-lait spots' is a minor point of overlap with NF1. However, the other key features like multiple lentigines and typical pulmonic stenosis are not primary diagnostic criteria for NF1, making it a less likely diagnosis compared to the RASopathies, which fit the overall clinical picture much better."
