      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with Atrial septal defect, Hypoplasia of the radius, Abnormal carpal morphology, and Cardiac conduction abnormality, which are strongly indicative of Holt-Oram syndrome. Cases with highly similar presentations have been diagnosed with this condition."

      "disease_name": "TAR syndrome (Thrombocytopenia-Absent Radius syndrome)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:274000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "TAR syndrome involves skeletal abnormalities including hypoplasia of the radius and cardiac defects. However, the absence of thrombocytopenia in the phenotype makes this a less likely diagnosis compared to Holt-Oram syndrome."
