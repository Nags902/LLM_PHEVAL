      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Classic presentation with radial hypoplasia, carpal abnormalities, atrial septal defect, and cardiac conduction defects. This is the most specific match for the combination of upper limb and cardiac features."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Features radial hypoplasia, but typically presents with bilateral radial aplasia rather than hypoplasia, and cardiac defects are less common. Would need platelet count to confirm/exclude."
