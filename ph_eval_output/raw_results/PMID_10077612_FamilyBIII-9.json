      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with a combination of atrial septal defect, hypoplasia of the radius, abnormal carpal morphology, and cardiac conduction abnormalities, which are consistent with Holt-Oram syndrome. Additionally, similar reference cases confirm the pattern of features typical for this syndrome."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:613426",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This disease is a variant of Holt-Oram syndrome characterized by atrial septal defect and skeletal anomalies. The patient's features align closely with this variant, although it is less recognized than classic Holt-Oram syndrome."

      "explanation": "While not as specific as Holt-Oram syndrome, this condition encompasses congenital heart defects along with significant upper limb anomalies, which aligns with the patient's symptoms but lacks the specificity of a classic diagnosis."
