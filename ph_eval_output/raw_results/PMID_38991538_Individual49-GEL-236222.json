      "disease_id": "OMIM:618089",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Strong match with reference cases 1 and 3 showing identical diagnosis. Patient shares key features including intellectual disability, developmental delay, microcephaly, seizures, short stature, delayed speech, and craniofacial dysmorphisms (tented philtrum, prominent metopic ridge, high forehead). Gastroesophageal reflux is also present in the reference cases."

      "explanation": "Reference case 2 shows overlapping features including intellectual disability, global developmental delay, microcephaly, delayed speech, delayed walking, gastroesophageal reflux, and high forehead. However, the patient lacks some of the more severe neurological features seen in case 2 like spasticity and dystonia."
