      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "KBG syndrome is associated with phenotypic features such as macrodontia, short stature, abnormalities of the hand, and delayed skeletal maturation; all features present in the patient. Similar reference cases diagnosed as KBG syndrome further support this as the most likely diagnosis."
