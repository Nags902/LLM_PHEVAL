      "disease_id": "OMIM:208900",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Ataxia-Telangiectasia is characterized by cerebellar atrophy, immunodeficiency (low IgG, IgA, and IgM), recurrent infections, pancytopenia, and increased MCV. The neurological symptoms like nystagmus, dysmetria, and ankle clonus also align."

      "disease_name": "Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:260400",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome presents with neutropenia, pancytopenia, and recurrent infections. While primarily associated with pancreatic insufficiency and skeletal abnormalities, the hematological and immunological presentations overlap."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:609529",
      "score": 0.3333333333,
      "explanation": "Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) due to TNFRSF13B can lead to decreased immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM) and recurrent infections, though it usually does not present with cerebellar atrophy or the specific neurological symptoms here."

      "disease_name": "Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:251260",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome shares features like microcephaly, immunodeficiency, and cancer predisposition. Cerebellar atrophy and nystagmus are less commonly associated, making it a less likely match."
