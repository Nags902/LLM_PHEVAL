      "disease_id": "OMIM:159550",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The clinical features of the patient, including pancytopenia, neutropenia, cerebellar atrophy, recurrent infections, dysmetria, nystagmus, and ankle clonus, overlap significantly with those of Ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome as seen in the reference cases."

    {
      "disease_name": "Shwachman-Diamond syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:260400",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This syndrome is characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, bone marrow dysfunction, and skeletal abnormalities. While the specific phenotype of cerebellar atrophy is not typical, features like neutropenia and pancytopenia, combined with recurrent infections, can fit with the immunodeficiency aspects of the condition."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "X-linked agammaglobulinemia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300755",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The decreased circulating levels of IgM, IgG, and IgA, along with recurrent infections, suggest an immunodeficiency such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Although not all features match, the immunological deficiencies align well."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:251260",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This syndrome involves immunodeficiency, chromosomal instability, and predisposition to cancer. The patient's immunodeficiency and pancytopenia could be explained by this condition, although it typically presents with microcephaly rather than cerebellar atrophy."
