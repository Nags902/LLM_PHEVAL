      "disease_id": "OMIM:300240",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Features pancytopenia, immunodeficiency (low IgG, IgA, IgM), cerebellar hypoplasia/atrophy, and bone marrow failure. However, typically includes additional features like intrauterine growth retardation and microcephaly not mentioned here."

      "explanation": "Can present with pancytopenia, bone marrow failure, and immunodeficiency. However, lacks the typical mucocutaneous features (nail dystrophy, skin pigmentation, oral leukoplakia) and the prominent cerebellar features are atypical."

      "explanation": "Features cerebellar atrophy, ataxia, nystagmus, and immunodeficiency (low IgG, IgA). However, telangiectasias and elevated AFP are typically present, and severe pancytopenia with myelodysplasia is less common."
