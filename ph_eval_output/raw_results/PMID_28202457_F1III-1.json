      "disease_id": "OMIM:159550",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This rare syndrome presents with cerebellar ataxia, pancytopenia, and predisposition to myelodysplasia, matching the patient's key features of cerebellar atrophy, dysmetria, nystagmus, pancytopenia, and myelodysplasia."

      "disease_name": "Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300240",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "A severe variant of dyskeratosis congenita presenting with cerebellar hypoplasia, progressive pancytopenia, immunodeficiency, and developmental delays. The patient's cerebellar atrophy, pancytopenia, and immunoglobulin deficiencies align well with this diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Dyskeratosis Congenita, X-linked",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:305000",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Features bone marrow failure with pancytopenia and increased risk of myelodysplasia. While it matches the hematologic findings, classic mucocutaneous features are not mentioned, and cerebellar involvement is less typical."

      "disease_name": "Dyskeratosis Congenita, Autosomal Dominant 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:127550",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Another form of dyskeratosis congenita with bone marrow failure and myelodysplasia risk, but cerebellar involvement and immunodeficiency are less characteristic of this subtype."

      "disease_name": "Fanconi Anemia, Complementation Group A",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:227650",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Presents with bone marrow failure, myelodysplasia risk, and increased mean corpuscular volume. However, cerebellar atrophy and immunoglobulin deficiencies are not typical features, and characteristic physical anomalies are not described."

      "disease_name": "Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:260400",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "Features bone marrow dysfunction with neutropenia and risk of myelodysplasia. While it can have neurological involvement, cerebellar atrophy is not typical, and pancreatic insufficiency (a hallmark feature) is not mentioned."
    },

      "disease_name": "Ataxia-Telangiectasia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:208900",
      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "Presents with cerebellar ataxia and immunodeficiency with low immunoglobulins and recurrent infections. However, pancytopenia and myelodysplasia are not typical features, and characteristic telangiectasias are not mentioned."
