      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Autosomal recessive form of distal RTA that presents with all the renal features seen in this patient. Deafness typically develops later, so its absence doesn't exclude this diagnosis in a 27-year-old."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Can cause nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and impaired concentrating ability. However, would typically cause hypercalcemia rather than RTA, and doesn't explain the alkaline urine or hypokalemia."
