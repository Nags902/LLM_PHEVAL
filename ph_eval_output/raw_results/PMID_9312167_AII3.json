      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features, including nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, hypokalemia, alkaline urine, impaired renal concentrating ability, and distal renal tubular acidosis, closely match the reference cases diagnosed with Distal renal tubular acidosis 1."

      "disease_name": "Distal renal tubular acidosis with progressive nerve deafness",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:267300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This subtype of distal renal tubular acidosis includes similar renal features but also involves progressive nerve deafness, which is not mentioned in the patient's data. However, it is a consideration given the renal symptoms."

      "disease_name": "Primary hyperoxaluria type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:259900",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 can present with nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis, but it typically involves hyperoxaluria and elevated serum oxalate levels, which are not mentioned here. It is a less likely but possible diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Bartter syndrome type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601678",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Bartter syndrome can present with hypokalemia and nephrocalcinosis, but it usually involves metabolic alkalosis rather than acidosis. The patient's alkaline urine and distal renal tubular acidosis make this less likely."
