      "disease_name": "Dent Disease 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300009",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Dent Disease 1 is characterized by nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and distal renal tubular acidosis, among other renal symptoms. The combination of hypokalemia and impaired renal concentrating ability fits the profile of Dent disease."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:606069",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition includes distal renal tubular acidosis, hypercalciuria (which can lead to nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis), and alkaline urine, matching several of the patient's phenotypic features."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:607364",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Bartter Syndrome Type 3 involves renal tubular acidosis, hypokalemia, nephrocalcinosis, and failings in urinary concentrating capacity. Although usually associated with other symptoms, the renal symptoms match well."

    {
      "disease_name": "Primary Hyperparathyroidism",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:145000",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Primary Hyperparathyroidism can present with hypercalciuria, leading to nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis, as well as metabolic problems like hypokalemia, although it typically involves different abnormalities in calcium levels."
