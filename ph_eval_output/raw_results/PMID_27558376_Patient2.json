      "disease_name": "Leukoencephalopathy, porphyria-related",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:612951",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features closely match those of the similar reference cases, including loss of ambulation, spastic paraparesis, cognitive impairment, optic atrophy, cerebellar atrophy, and increased CSF lactate. The absence of hearing impairment is noted but does not rule out the diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Spinocerebellar ataxia 29, congenital nonprogressive",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:117360",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits several overlapping features such as nystagmus, cerebellar atrophy, delayed ability to walk, and ataxia. However, the progressive nature of the patient's visual loss and cognitive impairment may not fully align with the nonprogressive nature of this condition."

    {
      "disease_name": "Hereditary spastic paraplegia with optic atrophy and neuropathy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:616907",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This condition fits with the patient's spastic paraparesis, optic atrophy, and sensorimotor neuropathy. However, the cerebellar atrophy and increased CSF lactate are less typical for this disorder."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607598",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "The patient's ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, increased CSF lactate, and progressive visual loss are consistent with mitochondrial disorders. However, the absence of other mitochondrial features such as seizures or myopathy reduces the likelihood."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Autosomal dominant optic atrophy plus syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:125250",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "The patient's optic atrophy and progressive visual loss are key features, but the additional neurological symptoms such as spastic paraparesis and cerebellar atrophy are not typically associated with this condition."
