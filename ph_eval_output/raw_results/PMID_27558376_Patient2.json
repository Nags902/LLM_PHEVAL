      "disease_name": "Leukoencephalopathy, porphyria-related",
      "disease_id": "None",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This diagnosis is explicitly linked to two highly similar reference cases (Case 1 and Case 2) that collectively cover a vast majority of the patient's symptoms: Loss of ambulation, Apraxia, Nystagmus, Ataxia, Spastic paraparesis, Sensorimotor neuropathy, Optic atrophy, Cognitive impairment, Cerebellar atrophy, Progressive visual loss, and Increased CSF lactate. The direct correlation with multiple reference cases makes it the most probable diagnosis based on the provided context."

      "disease_name": "Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611105",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This disease, caused by DARS2 mutations, is a strong candidate given the specific combination of symptoms. It characteristically presents with leukoencephalopathy, spastic paraparesis, ataxia, sensorimotor neuropathy, cerebellar atrophy, and crucially, increased CSF lactate. Optic atrophy can also be present. These features align very closely with the patient's comprehensive neurological and metabolic profile, and adult onset is possible."

    {
      "disease_name": "Progressive external ophthalmoplegia with mitochondrial DNA deletions 3 (POLG-related disorder)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:258470",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Disorders related to the POLG gene are a common cause of adult-onset mitochondrial disease with a broad spectrum of neurological manifestations. Key features in the patient such as Ataxia, Spastic paraparesis, Sensorimotor neuropathy, Optic atrophy, Cognitive impairment, Cerebellar atrophy, Progressive visual loss, and Increased CSF lactate are highly characteristic of POLG-related encephalomyopathies and PEO syndromes. This represents a strong etiological group for the patient's presentation."

    {
      "disease_name": "Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:540000",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "MELAS is a well-recognized mitochondrial disorder that fits several of the patient's symptoms, most notably the increased CSF lactate and encephalopathic features such as Cognitive impairment. Other overlapping features can include ataxia, spastic paraparesis, and sensorimotor neuropathy. While stroke-like episodes are a hallmark not explicitly mentioned, the presence of progressive neurological decline, visual impairment, and lactic acidosis makes it a plausible, albeit less specific, consideration compared to LBSL or POLG-related disorders."

    {
      "disease_name": "Spinocerebellar ataxia 29, congenital nonprogressive",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613614",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This disease is included because it appears in a reference case (Case 3) and shares some core features with the patient, such as Loss of ambulation, Nystagmus, Ataxia, Delayed ability to walk, and Cerebellar atrophy. However, it is described as 'congenital nonprogressive,' which contradicts the patient's age (P63Y) and implied progressive nature (Progressive visual loss, Loss of ambulation), and it does not account for a significant number of the patient's other key symptoms like Apraxia, Spastic paraparesis, Sensorimotor neuropathy, Optic atrophy, Cognitive impairment, and especially Increased CSF lactate. Therefore, it is considered less likely than the other metabolic and progressive neurodegenerative conditions."
