      "disease_name": "Common Variable Immunodeficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607594",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features closely match the criteria for Common Variable Immunodeficiency, including decreased CD4:CD8 ratio, B lymphocytopenia, and reduced immunoglobulin levels. This condition is supported by similar reference cases with a diagnosis of Common Variable Immunodeficiency."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Hyper-IgM Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:304400",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The combination of B lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and reduced IgA and IgM can also indicate Hyper-IgM Syndrome, particularly if class-switching defects are considered, although the clinical presentation may vary."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Severe Combined Immunodeficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601457",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "While the patient's presentation is suggestive of immunodeficiency, the absence of additional severe infections typically associated with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency places it as a less likely but still possible diagnosis."
