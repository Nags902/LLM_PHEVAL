      "disease_id": "OMIM:616873",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features closely match those in the reference cases, including decreased CD4:CD8 ratio, B lymphocytopenia, decreased IgA and IgM, and thrombocytopenia, all of which are hallmark signs of this immunodeficiency."

      "disease_name": "Immunodeficiency with hyper-IgM, type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308230",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition involves decreased IgA and IgM levels, and while it typically presents with normal or increased IgM, the patient's low IgM and other immune dysregulations suggest a possible variant or atypical presentation."

      "disease_name": "Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:601859",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "This syndrome can present with decreased CD4:CD8 ratio and thrombocytopenia due to autoimmune destruction, though the B cell abnormalities are less typical."

      "disease_name": "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:301000",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Known for thrombocytopenia and immune dysfunction, but the patient lacks eczema and recurrent infections, making this less likely."

      "disease_name": "X-linked agammaglobulinemia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300755",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This disease involves B lymphocytopenia and decreased immunoglobulins, but typically presents in childhood and lacks the CD4:CD8 ratio abnormality seen here."
