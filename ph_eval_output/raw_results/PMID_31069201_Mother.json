      "disease_name": "Common Variable Immunodeficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607594",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) is characterized by a defect in antibody production leading to decreased levels of serum immunoglobulins, specifically IgA, IgG, and/or IgM, which aligns with the decreased circulating IgA and IgM concentration seen in this patient. The decreased CD4:CD8 ratio, decreased class-switched memory B cells, and B lymphocytopenia are also consistent with CVID. The occurrence of thrombocytopenia in some patients adds further support to this diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:301000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) typically features thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent infections due to immune dysregulation. The immunologic profile of decreased CD4:CD8 ratio, decreased class-switched memory B cells, and B lymphocytopenia fits with WAS, along with decreased levels of serum IgM and IgA. Although eczema is not listed among the patient's symptoms, WAS remains a plausible consideration given the immunological findings."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:308230",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Hyper-IgM Syndromes are characterized by normal or elevated levels of IgM with low levels of other immunoglobulins, particularly IgA and IgG. Despite the fact that IgM is decreased in this patient, the immunological profile of decreased class-switched memory B cells, B lymphocytopenia, and altered CD4:CD8 ratios suggests an underlying defect in immunoglobulin class switching, a hallmark of Hyper-IgM Syndromes."

      "disease_name": "Idiopathic CD4 Lymphocytopenia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:606772",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Idiopathic CD4 Lymphocytopenia (ICL) is characterized by a low CD4+ T cell count without a known cause of immunodeficiency like HIV. The decreased CD4:CD8 ratio observed in this patient aligns with ICL. However, the additional B cell abnormalities and the decreased immunoglobulin levels are not typically associated with ICL, making it a less likely diagnosis."
