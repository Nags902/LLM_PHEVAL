      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Holt-Oram Syndrome is characterized by congenital heart defects (such as atrial septal defect) and upper limb abnormalities (including absent thumb and phocomelia), which match the patient's phenotypic features."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "TAR Syndrome typically presents with absent thumbs and upper limb anomalies, but atrial septal defect is less common. The absence of thrombocytopenia in the patient's features lowers its rank."

      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Roberts Syndrome includes phocomelia and other limb abnormalities, but atrial septal defect is not a hallmark feature, making it less likely than Holt-Oram Syndrome."
