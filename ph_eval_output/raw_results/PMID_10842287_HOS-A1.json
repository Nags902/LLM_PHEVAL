      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with Atrial septal defect, Absent thumb, and Upper limb phocomelia, which are classic features of Holt-Oram syndrome. The similar reference cases also strongly suggest this diagnosis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:274000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While the patient has Absent thumb and Upper limb phocomelia, the absence of thrombocytopenia and the presence of Atrial septal defect make this less likely than Holt-Oram syndrome."

      "explanation": "The patient has limb anomalies and a cardiac defect, but VACTERL typically involves vertebral, anal, cardiac, tracheoesophageal, renal, and limb anomalies. The absence of multiple features makes this less likely."
