      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (Dysarthria, Intellectual disability, borderline, Impaired tandem gait) closely match the phenotypic features of the similar reference cases, all of which were diagnosed with Spinocerebellar ataxia 29, congenital nonprogressive."

      "disease_name": "Spinocerebellar ataxia 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:164400",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Spinocerebellar ataxia 1 shares some overlapping symptoms such as Dysarthria and gait issues, but the intellectual disability is less commonly reported, making it a less likely match compared to SCA29."

      "disease_name": "Spinocerebellar ataxia 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:183090",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 can present with Dysarthria and gait ataxia, but the intellectual disability is not a hallmark feature, reducing its likelihood compared to SCA29."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:229300",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Friedreich ataxia often includes Dysarthria and gait ataxia, but it typically presents with progressive symptoms and additional features like cardiomyopathy, which are not mentioned here."

      "explanation": "Ataxia-telangiectasia includes ataxia and Dysarthria, but it also involves immune deficiencies and telangiectasias, which are not noted in the patient's features."
