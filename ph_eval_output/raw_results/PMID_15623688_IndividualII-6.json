      "disease_name": "Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300623",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This syndrome is a strong candidate given the patient's age (P58Y) and gender (male), as it typically manifests in carriers of an FMR1 premutation over 50 years of age, predominantly males. Key features include progressive intention tremor, gait ataxia (impared tandem gait), dysarthria, and cognitive decline, which could present as borderline intellectual disability."

    {
      "disease_name": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:183086",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "SCA6 is characterized by a relatively pure cerebellar syndrome, with common onset in the 5th or 6th decade, fitting the patient's age. Dysarthria and impaired tandem gait are cardinal symptoms. While often described as preserving cognition, mild cognitive changes can occur, making it a very strong contender for the core neurological symptoms."

      "disease_name": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:109150",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease, is the most common form of SCA. It presents with highly variable features, including progressive ataxia (impaired tandem gait), dysarthria, and often cognitive impairment. The age of onset is broad, commonly in adulthood, making it a plausible diagnosis given the patient's symptoms."

    {
      "disease_name": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:603513",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "SCA2 typically presents in adulthood with progressive ataxia (impaired tandem gait), dysarthria, slow saccadic eye movements, and often peripheral neuropathy. Cognitive impairment, particularly executive dysfunction, is also a recognized feature, aligning with the borderline intellectual disability described."

    {
      "disease_name": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:164400",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "SCA1 is another adult-onset progressive ataxia characterized by gait ataxia (impaired tandem gait), dysarthria, and brainstem signs. Cognitive impairment can also occur in individuals with SCA1, making it a relevant differential diagnosis for the patient's presentation."
