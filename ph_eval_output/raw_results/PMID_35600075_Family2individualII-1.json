      "disease_id": "OMIM:604233",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "GEFS+ Type 1 is characterized by febrile seizures that may persist beyond age 6 years and can evolve into various epilepsy types. The single phenotype of febrile seizures in this patient could represent an early or mild presentation."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:604403",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "GEFS+ Type 2 (SCN1A-related) presents with febrile seizures and can have variable severity. The isolated febrile seizure phenotype could be an incomplete presentation."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:604403",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "FEB3A is associated with SCN1A mutations and presents with isolated febrile seizures, matching the patient's phenotype exactly."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:604352",

      "disease_id": "OMIM:607208",

      "explanation": "Dravet syndrome often begins with febrile seizures in infancy. The single phenotype could represent an early stage, though additional features typically develop."
