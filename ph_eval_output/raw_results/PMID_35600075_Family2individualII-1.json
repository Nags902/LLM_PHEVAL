      "explanation": "Most likely diagnosis given the isolated presentation of febrile seizures. This condition presents with febrile seizures that may persist beyond age 6 and can occur in isolation without other neurological features."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:607745",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similar to reference case 1, though that case had additional features. This condition can present with febrile seizures in the specified age range and may have variable expressivity."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:613721",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Less likely as reference cases 2 and 3 show this typically presents with additional seizure types beyond febrile seizures, though incomplete penetrance is possible."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:607208",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Should be considered as it often begins with febrile seizures in infancy, though typically progresses to include afebrile seizures and developmental delays not yet evident in this patient."

      "explanation": "Another subtype of GEFS+ that presents with febrile seizures, though less common than type 1. May have similar presentation but different genetic basis."
