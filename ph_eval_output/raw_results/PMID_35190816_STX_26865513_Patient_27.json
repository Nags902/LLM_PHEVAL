      "disease_name": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:191100",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex is a highly relevant candidate. It is characterized by cortical tubers (a type of focal cortical dysplasia/malformation of cortical development related to heterotopia), severe epilepsy often including infantile spasms (hypsarrhythmia/hemihypsarrhythmia), global developmental delay, intellectual disability, autistic behavior, hyperactivity, and motor stereotypies. The wide range of seizure types and neurodevelopmental features, along with brain malformations, align strongly with the patient's phenotype."

      "disease_name": "Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia 1, X-linked",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300049",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This disorder directly accounts for the 'Gray matter heterotopia' feature. It is commonly associated with various types of epilepsy, including drug-resistant forms and severe early-onset presentations, and frequently leads to intellectual disability and developmental delay. Given the patient's female gender, X-linked dominant inheritance (due to FLNA gene mutations) is a strong consideration, as females are typically affected."

      "disease_name": "Lissencephaly, X-linked, with ambiguous genitalia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300215",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "ARX-related disorders, including X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia, are characterized by severe brain malformations (which can include heterotopia, lissencephaly, and other cortical dysplasias), profound intellectual disability, and early-onset, often refractory, epileptic encephalopathy. Hemihypsarrhythmia fits within the spectrum of severe seizure types observed. The global developmental delay, autistic behavior, and motor stereotypies are also consistent with this severe neurodevelopmental disorder."

      "disease_name": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300672",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD) is a leading cause of severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, frequently presenting with infantile spasms (hypsarrhythmia/hemihypsarrhythmia) and various other seizure types. It causes profound global developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, motor stereotypies, and autistic features. While gray matter heterotopia is not a primary defining feature, the severe epilepsy, developmental regression, and behavioral profile are highly characteristic."

    {
      "disease_name": "Polymicrogyria, Bilateral Frontoparietal",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:606852",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Bilateral Frontoparietal Polymicrogyria is a malformation of cortical development, related to gray matter heterotopia on the spectrum of neuronal migration disorders. It is known to cause intellectual disability, seizures, and prominent ataxia. While 'polymicrogyria' is the primary descriptor, its overlap with other cortical malformations and the presence of severe epilepsy (which could manifest as hemihypsarrhythmia) make it a plausible, albeit less specific, candidate."
