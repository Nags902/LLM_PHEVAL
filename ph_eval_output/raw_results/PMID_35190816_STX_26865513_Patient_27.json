      "disease_id": "OMIM:609304",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's presentation of early-onset seizures (including bilateral tonic-clonic, focal impaired awareness, and focal tonic seizures), global developmental delay, intellectual disability, autistic behavior, and EEG abnormalities closely matches the phenotype described in similar reference cases diagnosed with this condition."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:300049",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The presence of gray matter heterotopia, seizures, and developmental delay is consistent with this X-linked disorder, though the patient lacks some typical features like cardiovascular anomalies."

      "explanation": "The seizure types (including focal onset), developmental delay, and autistic features overlap with this X-linked disorder, though the patient is male and PCDH19 typically affects females."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:612164",

      "explanation": "The seizure types and developmental delay match this condition, but the patient lacks the more severe neonatal presentation often seen with STXBP1 mutations."
