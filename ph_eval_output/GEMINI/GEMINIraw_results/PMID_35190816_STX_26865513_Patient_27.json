      "disease_id": "OMIM:613721",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This disorder, caused by STXBP1 mutations, is a highly probable diagnosis due to the extensive overlap with the patient's clinical presentation, including global developmental delay, moderate intellectual disability, a wide range of seizure types (bilateral tonic-clonic with focal onset, focal impaired awareness, focal tonic, which can manifest as hemihypsarrhythmia in severe forms), ataxia, motor stereotypies, hyperactivity, autistic behavior, and EEG abnormalities with slow frequencies. The diagnosis in the similar reference cases ('Epilepsy, early-onset, 3') strongly points to this category of disorders, with STXBP1 encephalopathy being specifically classified as Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 4. While gray matter heterotopia is not a classical primary feature of STXBP1 encephalopathy, subtle cortical atrophy (like occipital cortical atrophy) and other brain abnormalities can be observed, and the overall clinical picture aligns remarkably well."

      "disease_name": "ARX-related disorders",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300382",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Mutations in the ARX gene cause a spectrum of X-linked neurodevelopmental disorders, making it a strong candidate for a male patient. These disorders frequently include significant brain malformations such as gray matter heterotopia (e.g., in X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia, Partington syndrome), and severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathies (e.g., X-linked infantile spasms syndrome, which is consistent with hemihypsarrhythmia and various seizure types). Additionally, features like global developmental delay, intellectual disability, motor stereotypies, and delayed speech are commonly observed across the ARX spectrum. Occipital cortical atrophy could be part of the broader cortical abnormalities."

      "disease_name": "Lissencephaly, X-linked, 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300121",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This disorder, caused by mutations in the DCX gene, is directly responsible for subcortical band heterotopia (also known as 'double cortex syndrome') in males, which is a specific form of gray matter heterotopia and a key feature in the patient. It is characterized by severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, and intractable epilepsy (including various seizure types and severe epileptic encephalopathy consistent with hemihypsarrhythmia). The patient's male gender is consistent with its X-linked inheritance pattern."

      "disease_name": "Periventricular nodular heterotopia 1, X-linked dominant",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300071",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Primarily caused by FLNA gene mutations, this disorder is a classic cause of periventricular nodular heterotopia (a specific type of gray matter heterotopia), directly matching a prominent patient feature. It is strongly associated with epilepsy (often focal, which can progress to severe and generalized forms, consistent with hemihypsarrhythmia), global developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Ataxia can also be a feature. The X-linked inheritance pattern is consistent with the patient's male gender."

      "disease_name": "CDKL5 deficiency disorder",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300203",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "CDKL5 deficiency disorder is a severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathy that explains many of the patient's core features, including intractable epilepsy (often presenting as infantile spasms or other severe seizures, consistent with hemihypsarrhythmia), profound global developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, motor stereotypies, and autistic behavior. Cortical atrophy can be present in some cases. While gray matter heterotopia is not a typical hallmark of this disorder, the extensive overlap of other prominent neurological symptoms makes it a highly relevant diagnostic consideration."
