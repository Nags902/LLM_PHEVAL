      "disease_id": "OMIM:613721",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This disease is highly ranked as it is the diagnosis in two of the provided similar reference cases (Case 1 and Case 2), which share a remarkable overlap in phenotypic features with the patient, including Cerebral atrophy, EEG with burst suppression, Epileptic encephalopathy, Focal tonic seizure, Infantile spasms, Intellectual disability, severe, and Multifocal epileptiform discharges. This strong direct correlation makes it the most likely candidate."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:612164",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This disease is the diagnosis in Case 3 of the similar reference cases, which presents with several key overlapping features such as EEG with burst suppression, Infantile spasms, Focal tonic seizure, Cerebral atrophy, and Intellectual disability, severe. STXBP1-related encephalopathy is a well-recognized cause of severe early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with a similar presentation."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:300672",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 2, also known as CDKL5 deficiency disorder, is a common and severe epileptic encephalopathy characterized by early-onset seizures (often infantile spasms), severe intellectual disability, and frequently cerebral atrophy. Burst suppression can also be a feature. The patient's presentation aligns very well with the core features of this condition, making it a strong differential diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 5",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607292",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Mutations in SCN2A (causing DEE5) can lead to a spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes, including severe early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE5) with features like infantile spasms, burst suppression patterns, and severe intellectual disability. Cerebral atrophy can also be present. This disease aligns with the overall severe epileptic encephalopathy phenotype seen in the patient."

      "disease_name": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 1 (ARX-related) is a recognized cause of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, often presenting as Ohtahara syndrome with burst suppression and infantile spasms, severe intellectual disability, and sometimes brain structural abnormalities including atrophy. Given the patient's severe neurological and epileptic features, this X-linked disorder is a relevant consideration."
