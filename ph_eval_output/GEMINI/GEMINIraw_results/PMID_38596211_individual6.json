      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with multiple classic diagnostic criteria for Neurofibromatosis type 1, including plexiform neurofibroma, multiple cafe-au-lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling, and glioma (often optic pathway glioma in NF1). Scoliosis is also a common associated feature. This constellation of symptoms aligns perfectly with all provided reference cases which were diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis, type 1."

      "disease_name": "Legius Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611490",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius Syndrome is considered in the differential diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis type 1 due to overlapping features such as multiple cafe-au-lait spots and axillary/inguinal freckling. However, Legius Syndrome is characterized by the *absence* of neurofibromas (including plexiform neurofibromas), Lisch nodules, and optic gliomas. Since the patient presents with both plexiform neurofibroma and glioma, Legius Syndrome is a significantly less likely diagnosis, but warrants consideration in a broader differential for conditions presenting with similar pigmentary features."
