      "disease_id": "OMIM:608072",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Perfect match with all three reference cases. Patient presents with all core features: myoclonic seizures, absence seizures, bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, dementia, progressive neurologic deterioration, gait disturbance, and myoclonus. Age of onset (20 years) is consistent with Lafora disease which typically begins in adolescence."

      "disease_name": "Myoclonic epilepsy of Lafora 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:254780",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The classic form of Lafora disease with identical clinical presentation to type 2. Both types present with progressive myoclonic epilepsy, dementia, and neurologic deterioration beginning in adolescence or early adulthood."

      "disease_name": "Progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 1A (Unverricht-Lundborg disease)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:254800",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Shares many features including myoclonic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, progressive course, and gait disturbance. However, dementia is less prominent in EPM1A compared to Lafora disease, and absence seizures are not typical."

      "disease_name": "Progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 1B",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:612437",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Similar presentation to EPM1A with myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizures, progressive course. Less likely due to absence of prominent dementia and typical absence seizures in most cases."

      "disease_name": "Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:606904",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Features myoclonic seizures, absence seizures, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. However, JME is not progressive and does not cause dementia or neurologic deterioration, making it less likely."

      "score": 0.167,
      "explanation": "Can present with myoclonic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and progressive neurologic decline. However, the specific combination with absence seizures and early dementia is less typical."

      "explanation": "Presents with myoclonic epilepsy and progressive neurologic deterioration, but typically has later onset and different seizure pattern compared to the patient's presentation."
