      "explanation": "Plexiform neurofibromas are pathognomonic for NF1 and occur in 25-30% of patients. All reference cases with plexiform neurofibroma were diagnosed with NF1. This is the most likely diagnosis despite having only one documented feature."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:162260",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Also known as schwannomatosis, can rarely present with plexiform neurofibromas, though typically presents with schwannomas. Less common than NF1 but should be considered."

      "explanation": "A localized form of NF1 that can present with plexiform neurofibromas limited to one body segment. Possible if the neurofibroma is localized, though full NF1 is more common."
