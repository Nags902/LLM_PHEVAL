      "explanation": "Reference case 2 with this diagnosis shows overlapping features including intellectual disability, delayed speech and language development, and notably short attention span which aligns with ADHD. The X-linked inheritance pattern is consistent with male patient."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Reference case 3 demonstrates exact match for all three core features: intellectual disability, delayed speech and language development, and ADHD. Though this case had additional features not present in our patient, the core phenotype matches well."
