      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Also known as NF1-like syndrome, presents with cafe-au-lait spots and freckling but without neurofibromas. Caused by SPRED1 mutations and clinically overlaps with NF1."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Can present with cafe-au-lait spots, though typically larger and more irregular with 'coast of Maine' borders. Less likely given typical freckling pattern."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:101000",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Can rarely present with cafe-au-lait spots, but typically fewer than in NF1 and freckling is uncommon. Usually presents with schwannomas."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:193520",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Allelic variant of NF1 with cafe-au-lait spots and freckling, but also includes pulmonary stenosis. Cannot exclude without cardiac evaluation."

      "explanation": "Formerly LEOPARD syndrome, can present with multiple lentigines that might be confused with freckling and cafe-au-lait spots, though less typical."
