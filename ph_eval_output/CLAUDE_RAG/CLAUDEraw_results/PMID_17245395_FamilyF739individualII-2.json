      "disease_name": "Tubulointerstitial kidney disease, autosomal dominant, 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:162000",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Both reference cases 2 and 3 with hyperuricemia were diagnosed with this condition. This is a hereditary kidney disease that commonly presents with isolated hyperuricemia in young patients before progression to chronic kidney disease."

      "disease_name": "Tubulointerstitial kidney disease, autosomal dominant, 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:174000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Another form of autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease that can present with hyperuricemia. Similar clinical presentation to type 1 but caused by mutations in different genes."

      "disease_name": "Familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy type 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:162000",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "This is essentially the same as ADTKD-1 but represents the earlier nomenclature. Presents with hyperuricemia in adolescence/young adulthood before kidney disease develops."

      "disease_name": "Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300322",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "HPRT deficiency (Lesch-Nyhan syndrome spectrum) can present with isolated hyperuricemia in milder forms. Given the patient is male, this X-linked condition should be considered."

      "disease_name": "Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300661",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "X-linked disorder causing overproduction of uric acid. Can present with isolated hyperuricemia in adolescence, particularly in males."

      "disease_name": "Glycogen storage disease type I",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:232200",
      "score": 0.17,
      "explanation": "GSD type I can present with hyperuricemia due to competition between lactate and uric acid for renal excretion. However, usually has additional metabolic features not mentioned here."
