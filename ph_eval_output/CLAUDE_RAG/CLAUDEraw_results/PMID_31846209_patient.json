      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's lobar holoprosencephaly, microcephaly, hypotelorism, and midface abnormalities (depressed nasal tip, high palate) are classic features of holoprosencephaly spectrum disorders. The associated seizures and hypotonia are common complications."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:157170",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "SIX3-related holoprosencephaly can present with similar features including lobar holoprosencephaly, microcephaly, and hypotelorism, though typically with more severe craniofacial anomalies."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:142945",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "SHH-related holoprosencephaly is another possibility given the brain malformation and facial features, though the relatively mild facial dysmorphism makes this less likely than HPE1."

      "explanation": "Similar cases 1 and 2 had this diagnosis with overlapping features including microcephaly, hypotonia, seizures, macrotia, high palate, and prominent fingertip pads, though they lacked the holoprosencephaly."

      "explanation": "ZIC2-related holoprosencephaly typically presents with more severe brain malformations and different facial features, making it less likely but still possible."
