      "disease_id": "OMIM:201910",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Classic presentation with clitoral hypertrophy and hyperpigmentation. All three reference cases with identical phenotypes were diagnosed with this condition. The hyperpigmentation results from elevated ACTH stimulating melanocytes."

      "disease_name": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:202010",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Also presents with virilization (clitoral hypertrophy) and can have hyperpigmentation due to elevated ACTH, but less common than 21-hydroxylase deficiency."

      "disease_name": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:201810",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Can cause mild virilization in females and hyperpigmentation from ACTH elevation, but typically less severe virilization than other CAH forms."

      "disease_name": "Aromatase deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613546",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Causes virilization in females including clitoral hypertrophy due to inability to convert androgens to estrogens, but hyperpigmentation is not a typical feature."

      "disease_name": "McCune-Albright syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with caf\u00e9-au-lait spots (hyperpigmentation) and precocious puberty which might include clitoral enlargement, but the pattern differs from CAH."
