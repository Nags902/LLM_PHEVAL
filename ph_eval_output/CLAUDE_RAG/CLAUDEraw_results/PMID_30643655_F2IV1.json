      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "All three reference cases with identical phenotypes were diagnosed with HSAN IIB. Patient shares key features: peripheral axonal neuropathy, acral ulceration, hyperactive reflexes, frequent falls, and spasticity."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:201300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "HSAN IIA is a closely related subtype with similar peripheral neuropathy and acral ulceration, but typically has less prominent spasticity and hyperreflexia than type IIB."

      "explanation": "HSP10 presents with spasticity, hyperreflexia, and peripheral neuropathy. However, acral ulceration is not typical, making it less likely than HSAN."

      "explanation": "HSAN IV can cause peripheral neuropathy and acral injuries, but typically presents with anhidrosis and insensitivity to pain from birth, with less prominent spasticity."
