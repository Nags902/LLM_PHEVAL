      "disease_id": "OMIM:236200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with classic features of homocystinuria including arachnodactyly, tall stature, intellectual disability, and hyperhomocystinemia. Case 1 shows a very similar phenotype with the same key features."

      "disease_name": "Marfan syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:154700",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Arachnodactyly and tall stature are cardinal features of Marfan syndrome. However, intellectual disability is not typical, and hyperhomocystinemia would be unusual, making this less likely than homocystinuria."

      "disease_name": "Homocystinuria due to defect in methylation (cbl C)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:277400",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This form of homocystinuria can present with hyperhomocystinemia and intellectual disability, but marfanoid features like arachnodactyly and tall stature are less common than in CBS deficiency."

    {
      "disease_name": "Homocystinuria due to defect in methylation (cbl D)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:277410",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Another methylation defect causing homocystinuria with potential intellectual disability, but marfanoid habitus is less characteristic compared to CBS deficiency."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:117550",

      "explanation": "Can present with tall stature and intellectual disability, but arachnodactyly is not typical and hyperhomocystinemia would be unexpected."

      "explanation": "X-linked disorder with marfanoid habitus and intellectual disability, but the patient is female and hyperhomocystinemia is not a feature."
