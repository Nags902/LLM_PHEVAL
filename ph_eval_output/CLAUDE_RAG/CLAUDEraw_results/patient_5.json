      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Perfect match with reference cases. Patient presents with all key features: glutaric aciduria, macrocephaly, cerebral atrophy, subdural hemorrhage, and dystonia. This autosomal recessive disorder caused by glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is the most likely diagnosis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:231680",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Also presents with glutaric aciduria but typically has more systemic involvement including hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and cardiomyopathy. The specific pattern of macrocephaly and subdural hemorrhage is less typical for type II."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Can present with macrocephaly, cerebral atrophy, and dystonia, but glutaric aciduria is not a typical feature. This organic aciduria affects different metabolic pathways."
