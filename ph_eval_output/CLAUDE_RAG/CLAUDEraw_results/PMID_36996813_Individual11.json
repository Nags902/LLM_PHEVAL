      "disease_id": "OMIM:620371",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Perfect match with reference cases showing identical key features: dilated third ventricle, lateral ventricle dilatation, cerebral hemorrhage/intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and cerebral calcification. Both reference cases 1 and 2 with this diagnosis share all major phenotypic features."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:175780",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "COL4A1 mutations cause cerebral hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and cerebral calcification. The vascular fragility leads to intracranial hemorrhages and secondary ventricular dilatation, matching the patient's phenotype."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:225750",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Features intracranial calcifications, particularly basal ganglia calcification, and can present with hydrocephalus and white matter abnormalities. However, typically includes more systemic features not mentioned in this patient."

      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Characterized by bilateral basal ganglia calcification and can present with neurological symptoms. While it explains the cerebral calcification, it less commonly presents with hemorrhage and hydrocephalus."

      "disease_name": "Sturge-Weber syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:185300",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with intracranial calcifications and occasionally cerebral hemorrhage due to vascular malformations. Hydrocephalus is less common but possible. Missing typical features like port-wine stain."
