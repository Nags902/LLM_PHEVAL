      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Perfect match with all three phenotypic features (atrial septal defect, absent thumb, upper limb phocomelia). All three reference cases with similar features were diagnosed with Holt-Oram syndrome, making this the most likely diagnosis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:274000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "TAR syndrome presents with upper limb malformations including absent radius and thumb abnormalities, but typically spares the thumb. The presence of absent thumb and cardiac defects makes it less likely than Holt-Oram syndrome."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:192350",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Can present with cardiac defects and limb abnormalities including radial ray defects. However, it typically involves multiple organ systems beyond what is described in this patient."
