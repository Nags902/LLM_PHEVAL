      "disease_id": "OMIM:175780",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Strong match with cerebral hemorrhage, porencephalic cysts, hydrocephalus, dilated ventricles, and white matter abnormalities. COL4A1 mutations cause basement membrane defects leading to intracerebral hemorrhages and porencephaly."

      "disease_name": "COL4A2-related brain small vessel disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:614519",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similar to COL4A1, presents with intracerebral hemorrhage, porencephalic cysts, and white matter changes. COL4A2 mutations affect the same collagen IV network in blood vessels."

      "disease_name": "Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:225750",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Features basal ganglia calcification, white matter abnormalities, and cerebral atrophy. However, hemorrhage and porencephalic cysts are less typical."

      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Presents with intracranial calcifications, hydrocephalus, and white matter abnormalities mimicking congenital infections. Hemorrhage is possible but less prominent."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:213600",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Characterized by basal ganglia calcification and can have associated neurological symptoms. However, lacks the hemorrhagic and cystic features seen in this patient."
