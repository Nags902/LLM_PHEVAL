      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Patient shares nearly all key features with reference cases 1 and 2: ectopia lentis, high myopia, arachnodactyly, pectus excavatum, generalized lipodystrophy, progeroid facial appearance, retrognathia, relative macrocephaly, prominent nasal bridge, high palate, IUGR, and bruising susceptibility. The combination of Marfanoid habitus with lipodystrophy is pathognomonic."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Patient has classic Marfanoid features including ectopia lentis, arachnodactyly, pectus excavatum, high myopia, and joint hyperextensibility. However, lipodystrophy and progeroid appearance are not typical of classic Marfan syndrome, making Marfan lipodystrophy syndrome more likely."

      "explanation": "Shares marfanoid habitus features including arachnodactyly and craniofacial abnormalities. However, lacks the characteristic contractures and has atypical features like lipodystrophy and ectopia lentis."
