      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Perfect match with all major features including glutaric aciduria, elevated 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, acute encephalopathy, dystonia, macrocephaly, enlarged sylvian cisterns, subdural hemorrhage, and neurological deterioration. All three reference cases with identical phenotype were diagnosed with this condition."

      "disease_name": "Glutaric acidemia type II",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:231680",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Can present with glutaric aciduria but typically has multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency with broader metabolic abnormalities. The specific elevation of 3-hydroxyglutaric acid and characteristic neuroimaging findings are more consistent with type I."

      "disease_name": "L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:236792",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Can present with macrocephaly, seizures, and developmental delay, but typically shows elevated L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid rather than 3-hydroxyglutaric acid. The acute encephalopathic crises are less characteristic."

      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Shares some features like seizures and developmental delay, but lacks the characteristic glutaric aciduria and 3-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. The acute encephalopathy pattern is different."

      "disease_name": "3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:236795",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Can present with developmental delay and neurological symptoms, but the specific metabolic profile with glutaric aciduria and enlarged sylvian cisterns is not typical. The acute encephalopathic presentation is uncommon."
