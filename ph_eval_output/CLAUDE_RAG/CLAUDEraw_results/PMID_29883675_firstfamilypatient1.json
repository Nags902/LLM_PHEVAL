      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Perfect match with all three reference cases showing identical core features: microcephaly, polymicrogyria, thin corpus callosum, absent speech, intellectual disability, and short stature. This appears to be the same syndrome."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:614851",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "RTTN mutations cause microcephaly with polymicrogyria, intellectual disability, and short stature. The thin corpus callosum and absent speech are also consistent with this diagnosis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:616402",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Features microcephaly, polymicrogyria, and intellectual disability. However, lacks mention of diabetes which is typically a key feature, making it less likely."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:251200",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "ASPM-related microcephaly can cause severe microcephaly and intellectual disability, but polymicrogyria is less common and the combination with short stature is atypical."
