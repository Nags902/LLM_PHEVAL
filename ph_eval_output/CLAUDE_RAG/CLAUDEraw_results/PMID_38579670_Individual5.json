      "explanation": "Patient's phenotype closely matches all three reference cases diagnosed with DEE 112, sharing key features of bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, epileptic encephalopathy, profound developmental delay, and hypotonia. The CNS hypomyelination aligns with the delayed CNS myelination seen in reference cases."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "ARX-related DEE presents with early-onset seizures, profound developmental delay, and hypotonia. The combination of epileptic encephalopathy with CNS abnormalities is characteristic of this X-linked disorder."

      "explanation": "KCNQ2-related DEE presents with neonatal-onset seizures, epileptic encephalopathy, and severe developmental impairment. Hypotonia is common, though specific white matter abnormalities are less typical."

      "explanation": "X-linked disorder primarily characterized by CNS hypomyelination and hypotonia. While seizures can occur, epileptic encephalopathy is not the primary presentation, making it less likely than DEE syndromes."
