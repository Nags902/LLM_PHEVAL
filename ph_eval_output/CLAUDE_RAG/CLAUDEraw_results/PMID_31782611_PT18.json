      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Often presents with developmental delays, speech delays, and CNS abnormalities including ventriculomegaly. The combination of motor and speech delays with brain structural abnormalities fits this syndrome."

      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Characterized by developmental delays, particularly in motor and speech domains, and can present with ventriculomegaly. Ocular abnormalities including astigmatism are also reported."
