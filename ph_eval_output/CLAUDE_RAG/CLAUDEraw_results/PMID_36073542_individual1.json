      "disease_id": "OMIM:620598",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient shares nearly all phenotypic features with the three reference cases diagnosed with DEE114, including focal seizures, hypotonia, cerebral palsy, autistic behavior, developmental regression, brain structural abnormalities (cerebral atrophy, ventriculomegaly, thin corpus callosum), and multiple dysmorphic features (exotropia, abnormal hair whorl, synophrys, deeply set eyes, uplifted earlobes, posterior helix pit, tapered fingers)."

      "disease_name": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 113",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:620229",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "DEE113 presents with similar features including developmental delay, epilepsy, hypotonia, and brain structural abnormalities. The presence of autistic features and regression also fits this diagnosis, though the specific constellation of dysmorphic features is less typical."

      "disease_name": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 112",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:620391",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "DEE112 can present with epilepsy, developmental delay, hypotonia, and brain abnormalities. However, the specific pattern of dysmorphic features and the degree of similarity to DEE114 cases makes this less likely than DEE114 or DEE113."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:308350",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "DEE1 (X-linked) could explain the seizures, developmental delay, and regression. However, it typically doesn't present with the extensive dysmorphic features seen in this patient, and the brain imaging findings are less specific for this condition."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:300672",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "DEE2 (CDKL5-related) presents with early-onset seizures, developmental delay, and hypotonia. While some features match, the specific constellation of dysmorphic features and brain abnormalities seen in this patient are less typical for DEE2."
