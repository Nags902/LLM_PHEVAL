      "explanation": "All three reference cases with chronic oral candidiasis were diagnosed with this condition. This primary immunodeficiency specifically predisposes to fungal infections including chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:613953",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Associated with IL17RC deficiency, presents with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. The isolated oral candidiasis in this patient could represent an early or mild phenotype."

      "explanation": "Caused by IL17RA deficiency, presents with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. Similar to other IL-17 pathway defects but with variable severity."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:614165",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "CARD9 deficiency causes susceptibility to fungal infections including chronic oral candidiasis. Often presents with more severe systemic fungal infections."

      "score": 0.14,
      "explanation": "Gain-of-function mutations in STAT1 cause chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis along with other infections. Often has broader infectious susceptibility."
