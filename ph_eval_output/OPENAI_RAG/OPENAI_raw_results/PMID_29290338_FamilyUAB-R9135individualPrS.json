      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis, type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:101000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Neurofibromatosis type 2 can involve plexiform neurofibromas, albeit less commonly than NF1. The absence of other classic NF1 features keeps this on the differential diagnosis list."

      "explanation": "Schwannomatosis is characterized by multiple schwannomas but can occasionally include plexiform neurofibromas, making it a less likely, but possible fit."
