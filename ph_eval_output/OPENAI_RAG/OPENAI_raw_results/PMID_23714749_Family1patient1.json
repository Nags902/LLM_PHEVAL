      "disease_id": "OMIM:614497",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The presence of hypotonia, global developmental delay, and increased lactate levels, as seen in Cases 2 and 3, suggests this condition. Although not all associated neurological and brain abnormality features are present, the overlap is significant."
