      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms strongly align with those commonly found in Holt-Oram syndrome, particularly the atrial septal defect, absent thumb, and upper limb phocomelia, which are consistent with the similar reference cases provided."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "TAR syndrome is characterized by upper limb abnormalities including thumb abnormalities which can present as absent, but is less likely due to the lack of thrombocytopenia report in this data."
