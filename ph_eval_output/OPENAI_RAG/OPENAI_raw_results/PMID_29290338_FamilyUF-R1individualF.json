      "disease_id": "OMIM:162200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms strongly match the classic presentation of Neurofibromatosis type 1, including plexiform neurofibromas, multiple cafe-au-lait spots, scoliosis, and spinal neurofibromas, which align closely with the reference cases provided."

      "disease_name": "Neurofibromatosis, type 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:101000",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Although Neurofibromatosis type 2 typically involves vestibular schwannomas, it can occasionally present with overlapping features such as spinal neurofibromas and cafe-au-lait spots, making it a distant possibility."

    {
      "disease_name": "Legius syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:611431",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Legius syndrome can present with multiple cafe-au-lait spots and mild neurofibromatosis type 1-like features, but it usually lacks neurofibromas, making it a less likely candidate compared to NF1."
