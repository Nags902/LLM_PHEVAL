      "disease_id": "OMIM:201910",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The clinical features of clitoral hypertrophy and hyperpigmentation of the skin, combined with the similarity to all reference cases, strongly suggest congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency."

      "disease_name": "Adrenal hyperplasia, congenital, due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:202010",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency can also present with clitoral hypertrophy and hyperpigmentation, but is less common than the 21-hydroxylase deficiency."

      "disease_name": "Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:201710",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia presents with adrenal insufficiency and can contribute to clitoral hypertrophy and skin changes, but the lack of additional features such as adrenal crisis makes it less likely."
