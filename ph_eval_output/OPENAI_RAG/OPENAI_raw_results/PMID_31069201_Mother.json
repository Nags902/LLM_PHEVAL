      "disease_id": "OMIM:615577",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits several key features consistent with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), such as decreased CD4:CD8 ratio, decreased class-switched memory B cells, B lymphocytopenia, and decreased levels of IgA and IgM. The similar reference cases, which were all diagnosed with CVID13, reinforce this likelihood."

      "disease_name": "X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300755",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition involves B lymphocytopenia and low levels of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM), resonating with the patient's immune phenotype. However, the decreased CD4:CD8 ratio is less typical, making it a less likely match compared to CVID13."

    {
      "disease_name": "Hyper IgM Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308230",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Characterized by a failure of immunoglobulin class-switching, leading to decreased switched memory B cells and potentially involving decreased IgA and IgM. Thrombocytopenia might also be associated due to autoimmune processes, which aligns with the patient's presentation."
