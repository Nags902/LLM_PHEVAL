      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Similar to LCA1 and LCA6, this subtype can also present with nystagmus and very low visual acuity, making it a plausible secondary candidate albeit ranked lower due to missing features like global developmental delay or specific eye abnormalities present in the patient."
