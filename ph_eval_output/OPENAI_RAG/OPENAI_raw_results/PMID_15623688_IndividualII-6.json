      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits symptoms such as dysarthria, intellectual disability, and impaired tandem gait, which are consistent with Spinocerebellar ataxia 29, as seen in similar reference cases."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:229300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Friedreich ataxia can present with dysarthria and impaired gait. Although intellectual disability is not as commonly associated, the presentation overlaps somewhat with the patient's symptoms."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:208920",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This condition includes ataxia which can encompass impaired tandem gait and dysarthria. Although oculomotor apraxia is not observed, the other features partially align."

      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Cerebral palsy can manifest with dysarthria and impaired gait. Even though it does not fully explain the intellectual disability level, it shares some characteristics with observed phenotypes."
