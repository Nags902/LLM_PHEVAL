      "disease_id": "OMIM:194050",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The presence of full cheeks, square face, anteverted nares, feeding difficulties, motor delay, delayed speech and language development, and anxiety closely match the features of Williams-Beuren syndrome. The presence of a depressed nasal bridge and deeply set eyes reinforces this possibility."

    {
      "disease_name": "Noonan syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Noonan syndrome can present with facial dysmorphism such as deeply set eyes, motor delay, and strabismus. The combination of phenotypes like delayed speech, feeding difficulties, and some facial features align with certain subtypes of Noonan syndrome, although less strongly than with Williams-Beuren syndrome."

    {
      "disease_name": "Kabuki syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:147920",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "Kabuki syndrome shares features of full cheeks, synophrys, anteverted nares, delayed speech and language development, and feeding difficulties, but the overall match with the specific facial features is weaker compared to Williams-Beuren syndrome."

    {
      "disease_name": "Smith-Magenis syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:182290",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Smith-Magenis syndrome includes features like facial anomalies, delayed speech, and behavioral issues such as anxiety, but lacks some specific characteristics like anteverted nares and synophrys present in the patient."

    {
      "disease_name": "Cornelia de Lange syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:122470",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Cornelia de Lange syndrome can include synophrys, deeply set eyes, full cheeks, and delayed development, but does not completely align with some of the other key markers like feeding difficulties and anxiety."
