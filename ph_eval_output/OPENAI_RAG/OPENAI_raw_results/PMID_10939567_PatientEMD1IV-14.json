      "disease_id": "OMIM:181350",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features, such as Achilles tendon contracture, spinal rigidity, scapuloperoneal amyotrophy, and arrhythmia, strongly overlap with cases of Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy 2. Reference cases with similar presentations have been diagnosed with this condition."

      "disease_name": "Bethlem Myopathy, Autosomal Dominant",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:158810",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Features like Achilles tendon contracture, gait disturbance, and proximal muscle weakness are also seen in Bethlem Myopathy, although some characteristics such as scapuloperoneal amyotrophy are less typical."

      "disease_name": "Collagen VI-related Myopathy, Bethlem Type",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:158810",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "This condition shares features like contractures, proximal muscle weakness, and gait disturbance with the patient, but lacks a strong association with arrhythmia, making it a less likely fit compared to the top-ranked disease."

      "disease_name": "Ullrich Congenital Muscular Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:254090",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This disorder also involves muscle weakness, contractures, and spinal rigidity. However, it typically presents with earlier onset and additional dermatological features not observed in the patient."
