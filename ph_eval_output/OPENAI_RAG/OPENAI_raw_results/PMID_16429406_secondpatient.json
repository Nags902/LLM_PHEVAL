      "disease_id": "OMIM:227650",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient exhibits classic symptoms of Fanconi Anemia, including chromosomal breakage induced by crosslinking agents, pancytopenia, absent thumb, absent radius, and cafe-au-lait spots. These features align closely with those observed in other Fanconi Anemia cases."

      "disease_name": "Fanconi Anemia, Complementation Group C",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:227645",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Comparable to reference cases diagnosed with Fanconi Anemia, Complementation Group C. Common phenotypic features observed in both the patient and similar cases include chromosomal breakage, absent thumb, absent radius, short stature, and cafe-au-lait spots."

      "disease_name": "Thrombocytopenia-Absent Radius Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:274000",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "The presence of thrombocytopenia, absent radius, and associated skeletal anomalies could suggest Thrombocytopenia-Absent Radius Syndrome, although chromosomal breakage is not typical, making this less likely."

      "disease_name": "Diamond-Blackfan Anemia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:105650",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Features such as anemia and short stature are suggestive; however, the chromosomal breakage and skeletal anomalies align less commonly with Diamond-Blackfan Anemia."
