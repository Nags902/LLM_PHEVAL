      "disease_id": "OMIM:614185",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features including long and smooth philtrum, thin upper lip vermilion, hypertelorism, short stature, mitral and tricuspid stenosis, and respiratory insufficiency are strongly correlated with Geleophysic dysplasia 2, as seen in similar reference cases."

      "disease_name": "Acromicric dysplasia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:102370",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Acromicric dysplasia shares many of the phenotypic features with Geleophysic dysplasia, such as short stature, full cheeks, and joint issues, making it another potential diagnosis, though it lacks some cardiac features."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:277600",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Characterized by short stature, joint limitations, and cardiac defects, Weill-Marchesani syndrome is a possible but less likely diagnosis due to the absence of ocular features typical of this syndrome."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:243310",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This condition is considered due to phenotypes like hypertelorism, smooth philtrum, and respiratory issues, albeit some characteristic craniofacial and neurological features are not matched."
