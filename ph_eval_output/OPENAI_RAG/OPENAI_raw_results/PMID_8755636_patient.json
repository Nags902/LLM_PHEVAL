      "disease_id": "OMIM:236200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The combination of arachnodactyly, intellectual disability, disproportionate tall stature, and hyperhomocystinemia strongly points towards Homocystinuria. The similarity with Case 1, which features the same diagnosis with overlapping symptoms of arachnodactyly, intellectual disability, and hyperhomocystinemia, supports this ranking."

      "disease_name": "Marfan Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:154700",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Marfan Syndrome is characterized by features like arachnodactyly and tall stature. Although the hyperhomocystinemia is not typical, the phenotypic overlap justifies consideration."

      "disease_name": "Sotos Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:117550",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "Sotos Syndrome can present with intellectual disability and tall stature. While arachnodactyly is not a classic feature, the other symptoms could suggest an atypical presentation."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:130050",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This condition can involve tall stature and, less commonly, features resembling arachnodactyly, making it a possible, albeit less likely, candidate."
