      "disease_id": "OMIM:256810",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The phenotypic features of this patient closely match those observed in the similar reference cases, which all were diagnosed with Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 6. Both the depletion of mitochondrial DNA in liver and the presence of symptoms such as jaundice, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, and abnormality of the coagulation cascade directly align with this condition."

      "disease_name": "Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 4A (Alpers type)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:203700",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Although there is a strong propensity towards Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 6, the depletion of mitochondrial DNA within the liver and associated hepatic manifestations might also suggest this disorder. Alpers type can present with hepatic issues, feeding difficulties, and neurological symptoms like hypotonia."

      "disease_name": "Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 10",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:615440",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "With features of mitochondrial DNA depletion, especially impacting hepatic function, this condition could also be considered. It is characterized by hypoglycemia, hypotonia, and liver-related symptoms, aligning with some of the exhibited phenotypic features."
