      "disease_id": "OMIM:612940",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's features of cutis laxa, joint hypermobility, hypotonia, inguinal hernia, bladder diverticulum, and telecanthus align closely with cases diagnosed with Cutis laxa, autosomal recessive, type ID."

      "disease_name": "Larsen syndrome, autosomal dominant",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:150250",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Larsen syndrome can present with joint hypermobility, facial dysmorphism including long face and telecanthus, and hernias. However, the presence of cutis laxa and other specific features makes this less likely than the top choice."

      "disease_name": "Coffin-Siris syndrome 3",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:614608",
      "score": 0.3333333333,
      "explanation": "Though Coffin-Siris syndrome is a less probable match, there is some overlap with features like long philtrum, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and hypotonia."

      "disease_name": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classical type",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:130000",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This syndrome could be considered due to joint hypermobility, thin skin, and bruising susceptibility; however, the specific pattern of dysmorphic features and hernias observed leans more towards Cutis laxa."
