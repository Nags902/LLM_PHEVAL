      "disease_id": "OMIM:615577",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The phenotypic features in the patient (e.g., B lymphocytopenia, decreased class-switched memory B cells, decreased IgA and IgM, recurrent sinusitis, and decreased response to polysaccharide vaccine) closely match reference cases 1, 2, and 3, all diagnosed with Immunodeficiency, common variable, 13."

      "disease_name": "X-linked agammaglobulinemia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Considered due to B lymphocytopenia and decreased Ig levels, though features like recurrent bacterial infections are less specific in this patient compared to common variable immunodeficiency."

      "disease_name": "Selective IgA deficiency",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:137100",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Characterized by decreased IgA concentration, which is present in the patient, but other immunoglobulin abnormalities are also observed, making selective IgA deficiency less likely than combined immunodeficiencies."

      "disease_name": "Hyper-IgM syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:308230",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Includes decreased IgA and IgG with normal or elevated IgM, not an exact match for this patient's profile but considering due to decreased IgM and specific antibody deficiency."
