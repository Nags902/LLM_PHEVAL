      "disease_id": "OMIM:231670",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The phenotypic features such as elevated urine 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaric aciduria, and macrocephaly align closely with Glutaric Aciduria Type I, supported by similarity to the three reference cases."

      "disease_name": "L-2-Hydroxyglutaric Aciduria",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:236792",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While the primary features match Glutaric Aciduria Type I, instances of elevated hydroxyglutaric levels suggest a potential overlap with L-2-Hydroxyglutaric Aciduria, although the fit is less precise."

      "disease_name": "Canavan Disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:271900",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Symptoms such as macrocephaly, seizures, and developmental delays could indicate Canavan Disease; however, absence of other characteristic signs reduces its likelihood."
