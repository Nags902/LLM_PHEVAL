      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Stargardt Disease is characterized by Bull's eye maculopathy, reduced visual acuity, and can lead to nystagmus. Peripheral retinal atrophy can also be a feature due to photoreceptor degeneration."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Retinitis Pigmentosa can present with peripheral retinal atrophy, reduced visual acuity, and sometimes Bull's eye maculopathy. Nystagmus can occur in some cases."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:169150",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This condition is associated with Bull's eye maculopathy, reduced visual acuity, and can include abnormalities of the peripheral retina, occasionally leading to nystagmus."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:303100",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Choroideremia can present with peripheral retinal atrophy and reduced visual acuity. Although nystagmus and Bull's eye maculopathy are less common, their presence could suggest this condition."
