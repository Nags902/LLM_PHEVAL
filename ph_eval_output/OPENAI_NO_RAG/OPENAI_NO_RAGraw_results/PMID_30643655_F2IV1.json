      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) Type 2A2 is characterized by peripheral axonal neuropathy and can present with hyperactive deep tendon reflexes and spasticity. Frequent falls may be due to muscle weakness, and acral ulceration can occur due to neuropathy."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:182601",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia 4 is a condition which causes spasticity and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes. It can also be correlated with falls due to gait issues."

      "explanation": "Friedreich Ataxia can cause frequent falls due to ataxia, spasticity, and peripheral neuropathy. While acral ulceration is not typical, neuropathic changes could lead to skin complications."
