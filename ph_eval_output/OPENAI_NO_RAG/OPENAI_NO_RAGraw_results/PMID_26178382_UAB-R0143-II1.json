      "explanation": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is characterized by multiple caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and freckling, especially in the axillary and inguinal regions. These are key diagnostic criteria for NF1, making it the most likely condition given the phenotypic features."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Legius Syndrome presents with multiple caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and freckling but generally lacks the neurofibromas seen in NF1. It can sometimes be misdiagnosed as NF1 due to similar cutaneous features."
