      "disease_name": "Susac Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:603005",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Susac Syndrome is associated with a range of neurological symptoms including ventriculomegaly. Although astigmatism is not a typical feature, the combination of delayed development may point to a neurological basis such as Susac Syndrome."

      "disease_name": "Aicardi Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:304050",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Aicardi Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by ventriculomegaly and developmental delays. It typically affects females, but phenotypic presentation may overlap with given features."

      "disease_name": "Walker-Warburg Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:236670",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "Walker-Warburg Syndrome can present with ventriculomegaly and developmental delays in motor abilities, which aligns with some presented features. However, it often includes more severe muscular and ocular anomalies."

    {
      "disease_name": "L1 Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:307000",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "L1 Syndrome is associated with ventriculomegaly and delayed development, but typically occurs in males due to X-linked inheritance; the astigmatism does not directly fit but neurological basis is plausible."

    {
      "disease_name": "Megalencephaly-Capillary Malformation Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:602501",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This syndrome often presents with ventriculomegaly and developmental delays; though astigmatism is not a primary feature, the brain overgrowth fits with ventriculomegaly."
