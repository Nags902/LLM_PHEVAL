      "disease_id": "OMIM:231670",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The combination of macrocephaly, subdural hemorrhage, glutaric aciduria, cerebral atrophy, and dystonia strongly suggests Glutaric Aciduria Type I. This metabolic disorder is characterized by macrocephaly and neurologic symptoms due to the accumulation of glutaric acid and related metabolites."

      "disease_name": "Canavan Disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:271900",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Although not all features match perfectly, Canavan Disease can result in macrocephaly and cerebral atrophy, with some metabolic abnormalities that could lead to overlapping symptoms like dystonia. However, the presence of subdural hemorrhage is less characteristic."

      "disease_name": "Alexander Disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:203450",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Alexander Disease could explain the macrocephaly and cerebral atrophy, but the metabolic feature of glutaric aciduria does not align. Dystonia can be part of the symptomatology, albeit not commonly."
