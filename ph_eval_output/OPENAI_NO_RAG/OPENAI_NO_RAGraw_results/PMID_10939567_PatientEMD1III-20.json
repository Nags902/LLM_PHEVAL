      "disease_name": "Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy 1, X-Linked",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:310300",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Characteristics such as elbow contracture, Achilles tendon contracture, elevated creatine kinase levels, ventricular arrhythmia, and scapuloperoneal distribution of weakness closely match the features of Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy, Autosomal Dominant 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:603511",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The proximal muscle weakness, waddling gait, elevated creatine kinase, and difficulty with ambulation fit the profile of Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy, particularly with features of autosomal dominant inheritance."

    {
      "disease_name": "Bethlem Myopathy 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:158810",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "Bethlem Myopathy can present with contractures (elbows and Achilles tendons), mild proximal muscle weakness, and elevated creatine kinase levels, which aligns with the patient's phenotypes."

      "disease_name": "Rigid Spine Muscular Dystrophy 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:602771",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Spinal rigidity, proximal muscle weakness, and elevated creatine kinase levels match Rigid Spine Muscular Dystrophy characteristics, though it is less common in this age group."
