      "disease_id": "OMIM:310200",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient has proximal muscle weakness, Gowers sign, calf pseudohypertrophy, scoliosis, highly elevated creatine kinase, and difficulty climbing stairs, all of which are classic features of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy."

      "disease_name": "Becker Muscular Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300376",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similar to Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy but with a milder progression. The presence of muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase supports this diagnosis."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2A",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:253600",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase. Although rarer, it fits many of the muscle-related symptoms described."

      "disease_name": "Congenital Muscular Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:613204",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This disease presents with muscle weakness and contractures from an early age, consistent with some of the features provided."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type III",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:253400",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "The proximal muscle weakness and motor delay may suggest a motor neuron disease such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy, though the lack of reference cases make this uncertain."
