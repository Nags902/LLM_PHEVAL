      "disease_name": "Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:225750",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome is known to present with cerebral atrophy, intracranial calcification (as seen with basal ganglia calcification), leukodystrophy, and hydrocephalus. The combination of these features and calcification supports this diagnosis."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Alexander disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:203450",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Alexander disease can cause megalencephaly, hydrocephalus, and degeneration of nervous tissues, which may lead to gliosis and abnormal myelination. The features match some aspects of the patient's profile."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Subcortical band heterotopia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300067",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "This condition can cause abnormalities in brain structure, including thin corpus callosum, hydrocephalus, and variable degrees of calcification, aligning somewhat with the phenotypic features observed."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy 1 (CADASIL 1)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:125310",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "CADASIL is associated with cerebral infarcts, vascular calcifications, and leukoencephalopathy, which might explain the cerebral hemorrhage and gliosis observed."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Griscelli syndrome type 3",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:609227",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "While primarily an immunodeficiency, Griscelli syndrome can present with neurological symptoms, including CNS abnormalities and gliosis, although less typical in this context."
