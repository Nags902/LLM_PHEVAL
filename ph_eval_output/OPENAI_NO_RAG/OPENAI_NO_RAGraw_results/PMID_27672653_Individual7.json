      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "All phenotypic features such as elevated urine 3-hydroxyglutaric acid levels, glutaric aciduria, macrocephaly, and developmental regression are consistent with Glutaric Acidemia Type 1, a disorder of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan metabolism. Subdural hemorrhage and cerebral atrophy are common secondary features."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:231680",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "While some features overlap with Glutaric Acidemia Type 2, such as metabolic issues and potential cerebral involvement, the presence of elevated urine 3-hydroxyglutaric levels is more directly indicative of Type 1."
