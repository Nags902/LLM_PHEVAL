      "disease_id": "OMIM:180860",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Russell-Silver Syndrome is characterized by features like short stature, delayed skeletal maturation, and hand abnormalities. Although macrodontia is less characteristic, the other phenotypes make it a primary consideration."

      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome 1 includes short stature and delayed skeletal maturation, alongside other characteristic features. However, macrodontia is not typical, which places it below Russell-Silver Syndrome."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:180700",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "This syndrome involves short stature and skeletal abnormalities, but macrodontia is not a classic feature. It fits some of the skeletal manifestations but less so the full phenotypic pattern."

      "disease_name": "Sotos Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:117550",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Sotos Syndrome can present with macrodontia and skeletal anomalies; however, it more typically involves overgrowth, contrasting with the short stature here."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:150230",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "This condition may include short stature and hand abnormalities, but macrodontia and skeletal maturation delay are not prominently featured, thus ranked lower."
