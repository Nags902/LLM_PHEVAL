      "disease_id": "OMIM:163950",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The presence of features such as cardiomyopathy, short neck, downslanted palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, and low-set ears are characteristic of Noonan Syndrome. The combination of broad neck, macrocephaly, and growth delay further support this diagnosis. Noonan Syndrome 1 is commonly associated with such phenotypes."

      "disease_name": "Noonan Syndrome 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:605275",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Similarities to Noonan Syndrome 1 with shared features including hypertelorism, downslanted palpebral fissures, low-set ears, short broad neck, and macrocephaly. Slight phenotypic variations can be observed in subtypes like Noonan Syndrome 2."

    {
      "disease_name": "Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:115150",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome shares several features with the patient's presentation such as macrocephaly, hypertelorism, cardiac abnormalities like cardiomyopathy, feeding difficulties, and ptosis. Also associated with growth delay and facial dysmorphisms."

    {
      "disease_name": "Costello Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:218040",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Features such as macrocephaly, hypertelorism, cardiomyopathy, feeding difficulties, low-set ears, and developmental issues are in alignment with Costello Syndrome. While freckling and caf\u00e9-au-lait spots are less commonly noted, broad neck and other craniofacial features are suggestive."

    {
      "disease_name": "Watson Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:193520",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Characterized by features like caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, macrocephaly, hypertelorism, and heart defects. The presence of freckling and some additional overlapping features raises the possibility, although it is less likely than the other syndromes listed."
