    {
      "disease_name": "Holt-Oram syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:142900",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Holt-Oram syndrome is characterized by skeletal abnormalities of the hands and arms (upper limbs) such as absent thumbs and cardiac defects such as atrial septal defect. The combination of phenotypes makes this a strong candidate."

    {
      "disease_name": "Roberts syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:268300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Roberts syndrome may present with phocomelia, specifically affecting the upper limbs, and occasionally includes cardiac defects. Although less common, the absence of thumbs could occur in severe forms, justifying this ranking."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "TAR syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:274000",
      "score": 0.3333333333,
      "explanation": "TAR syndrome is characterized by the absence of the radius and can potentially present with absent thumbs and cardiac defects. The presence of upper limb phocomelia aligns with TAR characteristics, albeit less prominently with septal defects, thus making it a lesser likelihood."
