      "disease_id": "OMIM:203100",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Oculocutaneous albinism can cause nystagmus, very low visual acuity, and refractive errors like hypermetropia. Eye poking can occur due to low visual acuity."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:216900",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Achromatopsia is associated with nystagmus, very low visual acuity, and poor eyesight, possibly leading to behaviors such as eye poking due to frustration or stimulus-seeking."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:309000",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "Lowe syndrome includes features of congenital cataracts which can lead to low visual acuity and nystagmus. It is also linked to behavioral symptoms like eye poking."

      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Leber congenital amaurosis is characterized by severe visual impairment from birth, nystagmus, and potential retinal dysfunction, which might contribute to eye poking behavior."
