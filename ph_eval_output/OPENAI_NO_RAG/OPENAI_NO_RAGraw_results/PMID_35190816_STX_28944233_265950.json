      "disease_name": "Rett Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312750",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Rett syndrome often presents with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, absent speech, seizures (including infantile spasms), and motor stereotypies. These match the phenotypic features listed. Although it primarily affects females, atypical presentations in males might occur."

      "disease_name": "Angelman Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:105830",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Characterized by intellectual disability, absent speech, seizures, microcephaly, and coordination problems, Angelman syndrome presents with many features observed here. Strabismus and broad-based gait might also occur."

      "disease_name": "MECP2 Duplication Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300260",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Associated with intellectual disability, seizures, microcephaly, absent speech, and gastroesophageal reflux. Although precocious puberty is less common, other features make it relevant."

      "disease_name": "Aicardi Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:304050",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "While Aicardi syndrome is often seen in females, it can feature infantile spasms, microcephaly, seizures, and developmental delay. The gender discrepancy makes it less likely but still plausible."

      "disease_name": "Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:610954",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Features include intellectual disability, absent speech, motor issues, microcephaly, and seizures. Presence of intention tremor and broad-based gait support its inclusion."
