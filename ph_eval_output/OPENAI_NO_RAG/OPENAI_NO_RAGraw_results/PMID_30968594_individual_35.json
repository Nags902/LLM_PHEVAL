      "disease_id": "OMIM:201910",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is commonly associated with clitoral hypertrophy and often presents with hyperpigmentation due to excess production of androgens and the activation of melanocortin 1 receptor by high ACTH levels, making it the most likely diagnosis given the features."

    {
      "disease_name": "Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300068",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Although typically not associated with hyperpigmentation, partial forms of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome could potentially lead to genital ambiguity, including clitoral hypertrophy, due to varying degrees of androgen response."

      "disease_name": "McCune-Albright Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:174800",
      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "While primarily characterized by fibrous dysplasia of bone, precocious puberty, and caf\u00e9-au-lait spots (a form of hyperpigmentation), the endocrine abnormalities in McCune-Albright Syndrome could theoretically lead to phenotypic overlap, albeit less commonly with clitoral hypertrophy."
