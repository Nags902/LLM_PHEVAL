    {
      "disease_name": "DiGeorge Syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:188400",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "DiGeorge Syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, is characterized by hypoparathyroidism, thymic aplasia/hypoplasia, and T lymphocytopenia, making it the most likely causative disease given the patient's symptoms."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "DiGeorge Syndrome 2",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:609535",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "DiGeorge Syndrome 2 represents other genetic variations and deletions that can present similarly with hypoparathyroidism, thymic defects, and lymphocytopenia, although it is less common."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "CHARGE Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:214800",
      "score": 0.3333,
      "explanation": "CHARGE syndrome can sometimes include hypoparathyroidism and thymus abnormalities. Though not as classic a presentation as DiGeorge syndrome, it remains a possibility given the phenotypic overlap."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Hypoparathyroidism-Retardation-Dysmorphism (HRD) Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:241410",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Features of HRD syndrome include hypoparathyroidism, with occasional reports of immune defects. However, this explanation fits less well as thymic or lymphocyte issues are not central features."
