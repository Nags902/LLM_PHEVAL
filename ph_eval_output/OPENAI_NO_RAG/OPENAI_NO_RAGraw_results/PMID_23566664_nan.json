      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Features such as osteoporosis, osteolytic defects, and characteristic facial structures align with this disorder. However, the thick eyebrows and large earlobe are less specific to this condition."

      "explanation": "Short stature, osteolytic defects, and facial abnormalities are consistent with Pycnodysostosis. The presence of vertebral compression fractures supports this possibility despite the age of the patient."

      "explanation": "This condition includes features such as facial abnormalities and skeletal anomalies. However, the specific combination of skeletal findings like vertebral and phalangeal issues is less typical."
