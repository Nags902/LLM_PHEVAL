      "explanation": "Shares features like developmental delay, seizures, and EEG abnormalities. Though less likely due to the prominence of infantile spasms in the provided features, it remains a possible consideration."

      "explanation": "Included due to developmental delay, absent speech, and possible seizure activity, although lacking specific infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia might reduce its ranking."
