      "disease_name": "Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA (Morquio Syndrome A)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:253000",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features such as skeletal dysplasia, short stature, and joint abnormalities closely match those seen in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA. The presence of coarse facial features and intellectual disability further supports this diagnosis."

      "disease_name": "Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia, Congenital",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:183900",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This condition is characterized by skeletal anomalies such as platyspondyly, scoliosis, and limb shortening, which align with the patient's symptoms. The wide pubic symphysis and other pelvic changes are also consistent with this disease."

      "disease_name": "Cartilage-Hair Hypoplasia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:250250",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Cartilage-Hair Hypoplasia presents with short stature and skeletal anomalies, including short metatarsals and metacarpals. The patient also exhibits fine hair that can be observed in this disorder."

      "disease_name": "Schmid Metaphyseal Chondrodysplasia",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:156500",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "The hypoplastic iliac wing and genu valgum suggest a skeletal dysplasia disorder. Schmid Metaphyseal Chondrodysplasia is known to cause similar bone dysplasia but does not explain all features such as intellectual disability."

    {
      "disease_name": "Metaphyseal Chondrodysplasia, McKusick Type",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:250250",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Also known as cartilage-hair hypoplasia, this condition includes features such as short stature and joint issues, but does not completely encompass the patient's intellectual symptoms."
