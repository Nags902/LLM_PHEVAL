      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The combination of proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase, calf muscle pseudohypertrophy, Gowers sign, and respiratory insufficiency strongly suggests Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a common condition in young males."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Shares many clinical features with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy such as muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase, and pseudohypertrophy, but usually has a later onset and milder course."

      "score": 0.3333333333333333,
      "explanation": "Presents with proximal muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase, but less likely due to the presence of pseudohypertrophy and axial muscle involvement."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:254090",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Characterized by muscle weakness, hyperlordosis, and respiratory problems, but typically includes joint contractures which are not reported here."
