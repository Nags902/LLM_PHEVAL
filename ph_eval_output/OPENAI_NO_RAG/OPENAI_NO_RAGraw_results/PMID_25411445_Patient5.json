      "disease_name": "Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:256600",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy is characterized by neurodegeneration featuring cerebral atrophy, spasticity, epileptic encephalopathy, and developmental delay, which closely match the presented phenotypic features."

      "disease_name": "Alexander Disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:203450",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Alexander Disease could account for cerebral atrophy, developmental delay, spasticity, and epileptic seizures. The presence of axial hypotonia and rigidity supports this possibility."

      "disease_name": "Lissencephaly 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:607432",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Lissencephaly is associated with cerebral malformations leading to developmental delay, epilepsy, and features of encephalopathy seen in the patient."

    {
      "disease_name": "Aicardi Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:304050",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Aicardi Syndrome can exhibit seizures (including epileptic spasms), developmental delay, and characteristic EEG abnormalities, although it's less likely without reference cases matching nuchal translucency and eye issues."

      "disease_name": "GM1 Gangliosidosis, Type II",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:230600",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "GM1 Gangliosidosis may lead to neurological decline presenting as developmental delay, spasticity, and epileptic encephalopathy. While it shares some features, it's less common."
