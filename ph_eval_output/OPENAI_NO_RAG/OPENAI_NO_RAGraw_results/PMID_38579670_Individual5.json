      "disease_id": "OMIM:618004",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The combination of CNS hypomyelination, developmental delay, and epilepsy aligns with Hypomyelinating Leukodystrophy 7, which is characterized by similar neurological symptoms including seizures and hypotonia."

    {
      "disease_name": "Aicardi Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:304050",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Aicardi syndrome is known for its triad of features involving agenesis of the corpus callosum, infantile spasms, and chorioretinal abnormalities, and frequently presents with seizures and developmental delay, despite not explicitly listing hypomyelination."

      "disease_name": "Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:312080",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease is a classic hypomyelinating disorder, characterized by hypotonia, cognitive impairments, and nystagmus, alongside seizures. Its presentation overlaps with the patient's hypomyelination and neurological symptoms."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:603896",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "CACH is associated with CNS hypomyelination and neurological symptoms including seizures, developmental delay, and ataxia, making it relevant although less specific without the full case presentation."

      "disease_name": "Megalencephalic Leukoencephalopathy with Subcortical Cysts 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:604004",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Characterized by large head size, delayed motor development, and deterioration in neurological function, which includes seizures and sometimes CNS hypomyelination, making it a possible match."
