Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: 
- Gender: 0

Phenotypic Features:

- Ataxia (HP:0001251)
- Aniridia (HP:0000526)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Ataxia, and Aniridia → Diagnosed as Gillespie syndrome (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Ataxia, and Aniridia → Diagnosed as Gillespie syndrome (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Ataxia, and Aniridia → Diagnosed as Gillespie syndrome (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.

Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.

=== Prompt ===
You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P2Y
- Gender: 1

Phenotypic Features:

- Nystagmus (HP:0000639)
- Very low visual acuity (HP:0032122)
- Eye poking (HP:0001483)
- Hypermetropia (HP:0000540)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Nystagmus, Global developmental delay, Very low visual acuity, Eye poking, and Hypermetropia → Diagnosed as Leber congenital amaurosis 6 (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Nystagmus, Global developmental delay, Very low visual acuity, Retinal pigment epithelial mottling, Eye poking, and Hypermetropia → Diagnosed as Leber congenital amaurosis 6 (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Nystagmus, Very low visual acuity, Retinal pigment epithelial mottling, Eye poking, Hypermetropia, and Global developmental delay → Diagnosed as Leber congenital amaurosis 6 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: 
- Gender: 2

Phenotypic Features:

- Infantile spasms (HP:0012469)
- Focal motor seizure (HP:0011153)
- EEG with focal epileptiform discharges (HP:0011185)

- Inability to walk (HP:0002540)
- Absent speech (HP:0001344)
- Hypsarrhythmia (HP:0002521)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Infantile spasms, Generalized tonic seizure, Severe global developmental delay, Inability to walk, Absent speech, and Hypsarrhythmia → Diagnosed as Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 4 (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Infantile spasms, Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure, Focal-onset seizure, EEG with focal spikes, CNS hypomyelination, Severe global developmental delay, Inability to walk, Absent speech, and Hypsarrhythmia → Diagnosed as Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 4 (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Infantile spasms, Intellectual disability, Motor delay, Delayed speech and language development, Microcephaly, Hypotonia, Myoclonic seizure, Atonic seizure, Focal impaired awareness seizure, Generalized non-motor (absence) seizure, Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure, Febrile seizure (within the age range of 3 months to 6 years), EEG with frontal focal spikes, Multifocal epileptiform discharges, EEG with polyspike wave complexes, Lower limb hypertonia, Lower limb hyperreflexia, Lower limb muscle weakness, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Ataxia, Spasticity, Strabismus, Nystagmus, and Cerebellar atrophy → Diagnosed as Developmental delay with or without epilepsy (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

=== Prompt ===
You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: 
- Gender: 0

Phenotypic Features:

- Bradyopsia (HP:0030511)
- Difficulty adjusting to changes in luminance (HP:0030512)
- Reduced visual acuity (HP:0007663)
- Photophobia (HP:0000613)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Bradyopsia, Difficulty adjusting to changes in luminance, Reduced visual acuity, Photophobia, and Nystagmus → Diagnosed as Prolonged electroretinal response suppression 1 (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Bradyopsia, Difficulty adjusting to changes in luminance, Reduced visual acuity, Photophobia, and Nystagmus → Diagnosed as Prolonged electroretinal response suppression 1 (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Bradyopsia, Difficulty adjusting to changes in luminance, Reduced visual acuity, Photophobia, and Nystagmus → Diagnosed as Prolonged electroretinal response suppression 1 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

- Case 3: Presented with Plexiform neurofibroma, Freckling, Multiple cafe-au-lait spots, Lisch nodules, Scoliosis, and Optic nerve glioma → Diagnosed as Neurofibromatosis, type 1 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

- Case 3: Presented with Iris coloboma, Nystagmus, Strabismus, Microphthalmia, Optic disc coloboma, Chorioretinal coloboma, and Retinal detachment → Diagnosed as Microphthalmia/coloboma 11 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P5Y
- Gender: 0

Phenotypic Features:

- Anemia (HP:0001903)
- Thrombocytopenia (HP:0001873)
- Pancytopenia (HP:0001876)
- Neutropenia (HP:0001875)

- Cafe-au-lait spot (HP:0000957)
- Absent thumb (HP:0009777)
- Absent radius (HP:0003974)
- Chromosomal breakage induced by crosslinking agents (HP:0003221)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Chromosomal breakage induced by crosslinking agents, Absent thumb, Short stature, and Leukemia → Diagnosed as Fanconi anemia, complementation group C (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Anemia, Pancytopenia, Cafe-au-lait spot, Hypopigmented macule, Bone marrow hypocellularity, Chromosomal breakage induced by crosslinking agents, Anterior wedging of T12, Short thumb, Absent thumb, Duplication of thumb phalanx, Absent radius, and Short stature → Diagnosed as Fanconi anemia, complementation group C (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Short stature, Cafe-au-lait spot, Bone marrow hypocellularity, Triangular face, Ventricular septal defect, Intrauterine growth retardation, Chromosomal breakage induced by crosslinking agents, Short thumb, Absent thumb, Duplication of thumb phalanx, and Absent radius → Diagnosed as Fanconi anemia, complementation group C (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

{
  "ranked_diseases": [
    {
      "disease_name": "DiseaseName",
      "disease_id": "DiseaseID",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Brief explanation."
    }
  ]
}
