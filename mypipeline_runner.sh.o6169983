Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)

=== Prompt ===
You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P30Y
- Gender: 1

Phenotypic Features:

- Ataxia (HP:0001251)
- Hyporeflexia (HP:0001265)
- Supranuclear gaze palsy (HP:0000605)
- Dysarthria (HP:0001260)
- Athetosis (HP:0002305)
- Hypoalbuminemia (HP:0003073)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Ataxia, Hyporeflexia, Supranuclear gaze palsy, Dysarthria, and Athetosis → Diagnosed as Ataxia, early-onset, with oculomotor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Ataxia, Hyporeflexia, Supranuclear gaze palsy, Dysarthria, and Athetosis → Diagnosed as Ataxia, early-onset, with oculomotor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Ataxia, Hyporeflexia, Supranuclear gaze palsy, Dysarthria, Athetosis, Hypercholesterolemia, and Hypoalbuminemia → Diagnosed as Ataxia, early-onset, with oculomotor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.

- Case 3: Presented with Postaxial polydactyly, Reduced visual acuity, Nyctalopia, Intellectual disability, Obesity, Scoliosis, Cataract, and Myopia → Diagnosed as Bardet-Biedl syndrome 1 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

=== Prompt ===
You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P2Y
- Gender: 2

Phenotypic Features:

- Hypotonia (HP:0001252)
- Global developmental delay (HP:0001263)

- Deeply set eye (HP:0000490)
- Brachycephaly (HP:0000248)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Macrocephaly, Delayed speech and language development, Global developmental delay, Hyporeflexia, Hypotonia, Macroglossia, Coarse facial features, Sloping forehead, 11 pairs of ribs, Long philtrum, Tented upper lip vermilion, Upslanted palpebral fissure, Epicanthus, Mandibular prognathia, Long eyelashes, Synophrys, Broad forehead, Wide nasal bridge, Bulbous nose, Open mouth, Thick vermilion border, Prominent metopic ridge, Hirsutism, Microcephaly, Short neck, Corneal opacity, Scoliosis, Hearing impairment, Global brain atrophy, Periventricular leukomalacia, Absent speech, Motor delay, Developmental regression, Seizure, and Deeply set eye → Diagnosed as Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 3 (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Hypotonia, Global developmental delay, Delayed ability to walk, Delayed speech and language development, Intellectual disability, Blepharochalasis, Full cheeks, Narrow palpebral fissure, Pointed chin, Sandal gap, Single transverse palmar crease, Bilateral camptodactyly, Atrial septal defect, Strabismus, Autistic behavior, Sleep onset insomnia, Seizure, Short stature, Sparse eyebrow, Bulbous nose, High palate, Narrow mouth, Broad nasal tip, Anteverted nares, Epicanthus, Macrotia, Long palpebral fissure, Long face, Long eyelashes, Frontal bossing, Broad forehead, Retrognathia, Prominent tragus, Short philtrum, Long philtrum, Smooth philtrum, Preauricular pit, Everted lower lip vermilion, Thin upper lip vermilion, Highly arched eyebrow, Micrognathia, Periorbital fullness, Low-set ears, Wide mouth, Short nose, Prominent nose, Frontal upsweep of hair, Abnormally large globe, Downslanted palpebral fissures, Depressed nasal ridge, Thick lower lip vermilion, Prominent nasal bridge, Triangular face, Mandibular prognathia, Broad eyebrow, Hypertelorism, Protruding ear, Wide nasal bridge, Coarse facial features, Brachycephaly, Tented upper lip vermilion, Proptosis, Small hand, Tapered finger, Broad foot, Toe syndactyly, Short palm, Clinodactyly, Arachnodactyly, Pes planus, Broad distal phalanx of finger, Deep plantar creases, Bifid uvula, Cleft lip, Short uvula, Joint hypermobility, Slender long bone, Sagittal craniosynostosis, Osteopenia, Metopic synostosis, Delayed skeletal maturation, Esodeviation, Recurrent respiratory infections, Pneumothorax, Pectus excavatum of inferior sternum, Striae distensae, Hypermetropia, Cubitus valgus, Vomiting, Recurrent otitis media, Asthma, Ankyloglossia, Gastroesophageal reflux, Primary amenorrhea, Syringomyelia, Cryptorchidism, Hirsutism, Aortic aneurysm, Duane anomaly, Tube feeding, Constipation, High myopia, and Hyperhidrosis → Diagnosed as Intellectual developmental disorder with dysmorphic facies and behavioral abnormalities (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Global brain atrophy, Delayed speech and language development, Motor delay, Global developmental delay, Hyporeflexia, Hypotonia, Macroglossia, Coarse facial features, Sloping forehead, 11 pairs of ribs, Long philtrum, Tented upper lip vermilion, Upslanted palpebral fissure, Epicanthus, Mandibular prognathia, Long eyelashes, Synophrys, Broad forehead, Wide nasal bridge, Bulbous nose, Open mouth, Thick vermilion border, Prominent metopic ridge, Hirsutism, Microcephaly, Macrocephaly, Short neck, Corneal opacity, Scoliosis, Hearing impairment, Periventricular leukomalacia, Absent speech, Developmental regression, Seizure, Deeply set eye, Decreased fetal movement, and Oligohydramnios → Diagnosed as Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 3 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

```json
{
  "ranked_diseases": [
    {
      "disease_name": "DiseaseName",
      "disease_id": "DiseaseID",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Brief explanation."
    }
  ]
}
```
