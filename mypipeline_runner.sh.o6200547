For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.

      "explanation": "PMM2-CDG is the most common congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) and is strongly indicated by the characteristic 'Type I transferrin isoform profile' found in the patient. It aligns exceptionally well with core neurological features such as cerebellar atrophy (a hallmark feature), seizures, hypotonia, esotropia, and cerebral atrophy. Other consistent findings include failure to thrive and hypoalbuminemia. While fetal pericardial effusion and polycystic kidney dysplasia are less typical primary features of PMM2-CDG, severe, early-onset forms of CDG can present with broader multi-organ involvement, and these findings are not entirely exclusionary within the spectrum of the disease."

      "explanation": "ALG1-CDG is a significant candidate due to its characteristic 'Type I transferrin isoform profile' and strong match with several patient features. It accounts for severe neurological manifestations like seizures, hypotonia, cerebral atrophy, and failure to thrive. Notably, ALG1-CDG is more frequently associated with cardiac anomalies, including fetal pericardial effusion, and renal abnormalities, specifically renal cysts (which can manifest as polycystic kidney dysplasia), making it an excellent fit for these less common but critical findings in the patient's presentation."

Key features aligning with the patient's presentation include cerebellar atrophy, seizures, hypotonia, and failure to thrive. However, explicit documentation of polycystic kidney dysplasia and fetal pericardial effusion as prominent features is less established for ALG3-CDG compared to other CDG subtypes, positioning it slightly lower in the ranking."

      "explanation": "DPAGT1-CDG is a Type I congenital disorder of glycosylation that presents with a 'Type I transferrin isoform profile' and is notably associated with renal cysts, which aligns with the patient's polycystic kidney dysplasia. While it can cause neurological symptoms such as hypotonia and seizures, the extensive brain atrophy (cerebral and cerebellar) and fetal pericardial effusion are less consistently reported as hallmark features compared to other Type I CDGs."

      "explanation": "CDKL5 deficiency disorder is an X-linked dominant condition, primarily affecting females but also severe in affected males (Gender: 1). It is characterized by severe early-onset epilepsy (often including infantile spasms/hypsarrhythmia, which aligns with hemihypsarrhythmia), profound global developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, motor stereotypies, and autistic features. While gray matter heterotopia is not a defining or typical brain imaging finding, non-specific cortical changes or atrophy can occur. The overall constellation of severe epileptic encephalopathy and neurodevelopmental impairment makes it a plausible consideration, despite the absence of specific gray matter heterotopia."

Global developmental delay and dysarthria (speech difficulties) are common. While not a primary feature, cognitive decline or intellectual disability, including borderline, can be present. The absence of telangiectasias or immune dysfunction in the listed features makes it a slightly less definitive match without further information, but the core neurological symptoms are highly consistent."

However, its typical clinical presentation often involves severe metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, cardiomyopathy, and liver dysfunction. While neurological symptoms can occur, the specific combination of prominent macrocephaly, characteristic cerebral atrophy (especially basal ganglia specific patterns) and severe dystonia, as well as recurrent subdural hemorrhage, is less typical and less frequently reported compared to Glutaric Aciduria Type 1. It is considered a differential diagnosis primarily due to the shared key feature of glutaric aciduria."

Facial features can include hypertelorism, full cheeks, and a broad or short nose, aligning with several listed features. The main discrepancy lies in the specific philtrum and lip descriptions ('long philtrum', 'smooth philtrum', 'thin upper lip vermilion'), as MPS facial coarsening usually involves thick lips and a less specific philtrum.

The inconsistencies with 'long philtrum', 'smooth philtrum', and 'thin upper lip vermilion' are similar to those of MPS VI.

Moderately short stature is also a hallmark. While joint limitation can occur, particularly in severe forms or related to limb defects, it is not as universally prominent as in MPS or TRPS II. 'Smooth philtrum' is generally not a defining characteristic (CdLS often has a distinct philtrum), nor are 'hypertelorism' or 'full cheeks'. The absence of other classic CdLS features like synophrys or downturned mouth also reduces its overall fit, but the specific philtrum/lip match remains notable."

It predominantly affects females. While precocious puberty and sensorineural hearing impairment are not classic features, the strong match for the core epileptic encephalopathy and severe neurodevelopmental profile makes it a top candidate.

Hypothalamic hamartomas can lead to significant intellectual disability, global developmental delay, and behavioral issues depending on size and location. While microcephaly is not a typical feature (often normal head size or macrocephaly if hydrocephalus), and SNHL is not directly associated, the unique co-occurrence of precocious puberty and infantile spasms is a strong indicator for this condition."

Sensorineural hearing impairment is also a known feature in some mitochondrial disorders. While precocious puberty is not a hallmark, mitochondrial diseases are multisystemic and can cause a wide array of variable symptoms, including endocrine dysfunction.

Hyperuricemia can be a feature due to impaired tubular uric acid handling, often accompanied by nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis (though not explicitly mentioned here). The strong renal tubular connection leading to proteinuria and CKD, coupled with the potential for hyperuricemia, makes it a significant candidate. While X-linked, presentation in a female is possible due to skewed X-inactivation or as a milder phenotype."
