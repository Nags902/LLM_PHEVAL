Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P17Y
- Gender: 2

Phenotypic Features:

- Freckling (HP:0001480)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Axillary freckling, Multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and Inguinal freckling → Diagnosed as Neurofibromatosis, type 1 (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Freckling, and Multiple cafe-au-lait spots → Diagnosed as Neurofibromatosis, type 1 (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Axillary freckling, Inguinal freckling, Multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and Plexiform neurofibroma → Diagnosed as Neurofibromatosis, type 1 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P13Y
- Gender: 2

Phenotypic Features:

- Plexiform neurofibroma (HP:0009732)
- Freckling (HP:0001480)
- Multiple cafe-au-lait spots (HP:0007565)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Freckling, Multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and Plexiform neurofibroma → Diagnosed as Neurofibromatosis, type 1 (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Multiple cafe-au-lait spots, Plexiform neurofibroma, Freckling, and Scoliosis → Diagnosed as Neurofibromatosis, type 1 (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Axillary freckling, Inguinal freckling, Multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and Plexiform neurofibroma → Diagnosed as Neurofibromatosis, type 1 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

- Case 3: Presented with Delayed speech and language development, Intellectual disability, mild, Hypotonia, Microcephaly, and Short stature → Diagnosed as Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia and speech delay, with or without seizures (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: 
- Gender: 2

Phenotypic Features:

- Decreased serum testosterone concentration (HP:0040171)
- Increased circulating ACTH level (HP:0003154)
- Increased circulating prolactin concentration (HP:0000870)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Decreased serum testosterone concentration, Increased circulating ACTH level, Abnormality of circulating cortisol level, Increased circulating prolactin concentration, and Abnormal serum estradiol → Diagnosed as Adrenal hyperplasia, congenital, due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Decreased serum testosterone concentration, Abnormal circulating adrenocorticotropin concentration, Abnormality of circulating cortisol level, Increased circulating prolactin concentration, and Abnormal serum estradiol → Diagnosed as Adrenal hyperplasia, congenital, due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Abnormal circulating testosterone concentration, Abnormal circulating adrenocorticotropin concentration, Abnormality of circulating cortisol level, and Increased circulating prolactin concentration → Diagnosed as Adrenal hyperplasia, congenital, due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P12Y
- Gender: 1

Phenotypic Features:

- Dysphagia (HP:0002015)
- Respiratory insufficiency (HP:0002093)
- Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)
- Asthenia (HP:0025406)
- Ptosis (HP:0000508)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Dysphagia, Respiratory insufficiency, Ophthalmoplegia, Asthenia, and Ptosis → Diagnosed as Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy 2 (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Dysphagia, Respiratory insufficiency, Ophthalmoplegia, Asthenia, and Ptosis → Diagnosed as Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy 2 (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Dysphagia, Respiratory insufficiency, Ophthalmoplegia, Asthenia, and Ptosis → Diagnosed as Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy 2 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P45Y
- Gender: 0

Phenotypic Features:

- Chronic kidney disease (HP:0012622)
- Gout (HP:0001997)
- Renal cyst (HP:0000107)
- Renal interstitial fibrosis (HP:0032948)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Chronic kidney disease, Gout, Renal cyst, Renal interstitial fibrosis, and Stage 5 chronic kidney disease → Diagnosed as Tubulointerstitial kidney disease, autosomal dominant, 3 (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease, Gout, Renal cyst, and Renal interstitial fibrosis → Diagnosed as Tubulointerstitial kidney disease, autosomal dominant, 1 (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease, Gout, Renal cyst, and Renal interstitial fibrosis → Diagnosed as Tubulointerstitial kidney disease, autosomal dominant, 1 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

- Case 3: Presented with Global brain atrophy, Delayed speech and language development, Motor delay, Global developmental delay, Hyporeflexia, Hypotonia, Macroglossia, Coarse facial features, Sloping forehead, 11 pairs of ribs, Long philtrum, Tented upper lip vermilion, Upslanted palpebral fissure, Epicanthus, Mandibular prognathia, Long eyelashes, Synophrys, Broad forehead, Wide nasal bridge, Bulbous nose, Open mouth, Thick vermilion border, Prominent metopic ridge, Hirsutism, Microcephaly, Macrocephaly, Short neck, Corneal opacity, Scoliosis, Hearing impairment, Periventricular leukomalacia, Absent speech, Developmental regression, Seizure, Deeply set eye, Decreased fetal movement, and Oligohydramnios → Diagnosed as Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 3 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

```json
{
  "ranked_diseases": [
    {
      "disease_name": "DiseaseName",
      "disease_id": "DiseaseID",
      "score": 1.0,
