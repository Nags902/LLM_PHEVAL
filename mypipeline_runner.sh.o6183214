Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.

      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This specific subtype of Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation (CDG) is a strong candidate as it explains a remarkable number of the patient's severe and diverse features. It is characterized by a Type I transferrin isoform profile, which is a key diagnostic finding in the patient. Furthermore, ALG1-CDG can present with fetal pericardial effusion, seizures, cerebellar atrophy, cerebral atrophy, hypotonia, failure to thrive, and esotropia. Notably, polycystic kidney dysplasia has also been reported in patients with ALG1-CDG, making it an excellent match for the patient's complex phenotype."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:608094",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "DPAGT1-CDG represents another severe form of Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation that frequently manifests with features observed in the patient. These include a Type I transferrin isoform profile, fetal pericardial effusion (often as part of hydrops fetalis), seizures, cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, hypotonia, and failure to thrive. Polycystic kidneys have also been documented in this condition. While often leading to severe outcomes, the patient's presentation aligns well with the known spectrum of DPAGT1-CDG."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:212065",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "As the most common type of CDG, PMM2-CDG is a significant consideration. It robustly explains the Type I transferrin isoform profile, hypotonia, seizures, cerebellar atrophy, cerebral atrophy, failure to thrive, and esotropia. While fetal pericardial effusion and polycystic kidney dysplasia are less typical for PMM2-CDG compared to some other CDG types, severe or atypical presentations can be pleiotropic. Given the strong evidence for CDG in general, PMM2-CDG remains a highly plausible diagnosis to investigate."

      "disease_name": "Coenzyme Q10 deficiency, primary, 7",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:616227",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This diagnosis is included primarily because it was identified in a similar reference case that shared cerebellar atrophy and seizures with the current patient. However, Coenzyme Q10 deficiency does not typically explain the fetal pericardial effusion, polycystic kidney dysplasia, or, critically, the Type I transferrin isoform profile, which is a highly specific marker for CDG. Therefore, while some neurological symptoms overlap, it is a less likely diagnosis compared to the CDG subtypes, given the full phenotypic spectrum."

      "explanation": "This syndrome is strongly indicated by the presence of Astigmatism, Delayed gross motor development, and Delayed speech and language development, which directly match three of the patient's four phenotypic features. This alignment is further supported by Reference Case 3, which presents with the identical trio of these features. While ventriculomegaly is not a classic finding in White-Sutton syndrome, its occurrence does not definitively exclude the diagnosis, as brain imaging findings can be variable in related developmental disorders."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "X-linked hydrocephalus (part of the L1CAM-related disorder spectrum) is a strong candidate because ventriculomegaly is a hallmark feature, and significant global developmental delays (including motor and speech) are common. While astigmatism is not a primary feature, other ocular issues like strabismus can be present, and specific refractive errors might occur. Although typically X-linked and more common in males, affected females can be observed due to de novo mutations or skewed X-inactivation, making it a plausible consideration."

Severe ocular anomalies are also a cardinal feature, which could encompass astigmatism. Although typically a more severe condition with earlier mortality, it aligns well with the key features of ventriculomegaly and developmental delays alongside ocular involvement, making it a differential diagnosis."

The patient presents with 'Multiple cafe-au-lait spots' and 'Freckling', which are two cardinal diagnostic criteria for Neurofibromatosis type 1 (specifically, six or more cafe-au-lait spots and axillary/inguinal freckling). The similar reference cases strongly support this diagnosis, as all three cases with similar skin manifestations were diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis, type 1.

While 'Freckling' (lentigines) is characteristic of the LEOPARD variant (Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines), general Noonan syndrome can sometimes have cafe-au-lait spots, though less commonly and typically fewer than in NF1.

      "explanation": "This disease perfectly matches all of the patient's phenotypic features: Global developmental delay, Increased circulating lactate concentration, Hypoglycemia, Abnormality of the coagulation cascade, and Hypotonia. Its strong resemblance to Reference Case 1, which was diagnosed with this condition and presented with the exact same set of overlapping features, makes it the most likely candidate. The hepatocerebral type specifically accounts for both the neurological symptoms and the severe liver dysfunction leading to hypoglycemia and coagulation issues."

Liver involvement in GSD Type I frequently leads to hepatomegaly and can cause abnormalities of the coagulation cascade. Hypotonia can also be present, and global developmental delay may occur secondary to chronic metabolic derangements, making it a very plausible alternative diagnosis."

However, it does not typically present with the prominent hypoglycemia or abnormality of the coagulation cascade, which are significant features in the patient's presentation. Therefore, while a possibility, it is a less comprehensive match than the top two candidates."

During metabolic crises, patients can experience hypoglycemia and liver dysfunction which may lead to coagulation abnormalities. This metabolic disorder shares a significant overlap with the patient's symptoms, making it a strong differential diagnosis."

      "explanation": "The patient presents with a classic constellation of features highly characteristic of Noonan Syndrome. These include multiple cardiac defects (Patent ductus arteriosus, Coarctation of aorta), distinctive craniofacial dysmorphism (short neck, microretrognathia, hypertelorism, telecanthus, depressed nasal bridge, prominent forehead, blepharophimosis, abnormal helix morphology), skeletal anomalies (pectus carinatum, delayed skeletal maturation), cryptorchidism, and global developmental delay with delayed speech. Hypothyroidism and delayed eruption of teeth are also known associations. This extensive overlap strongly supports Noonan Syndrome, a RASopathy, as the primary diagnosis. The phenotypic overlap with 'Cardiac, facial, and digital anomalies with developmental delay' cases (Cases 1 & 2) further reinforces this, as these cases often represent undiagnosed or atypical RASopathies, with many features consistent with Noonan Syndrome."

However, the patient's presentation includes several features less typical for KBG syndrome, such as Patent Ductus Arteriosus, Coarctation of Aorta, short neck, prominent forehead, telecanthus, hypothyroidism, pectus carinatum, blepharophimosis, and abnormal helix morphology. Crucially, hallmark features of KBG syndrome like macrodontia are not present in the patient's phenotype, making it less likely than the RASopathies but still a possible consideration given the initial overlap."

      "explanation": "The patient's phenotypic features show an exceptionally high degree of overlap with all three provided reference cases, which are consistently diagnosed with Muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, autosomal recessive 29 (LGMD R9). All listed patient symptoms, including the more specific features like 'pain insensitivity' and 'increased endomysial connective tissue', are present in at least one or all of the reference cases, making this the most likely diagnosis. The constellation of proximal and distal muscle weakness, Gowers sign, calf pseudohypertrophy, highly elevated CK, motor delay, contractures, and scoliosis is highly characteristic of this specific form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy."

While DMD presents very similarly, the explicit presence of 'pain insensitivity' in the patient and the reference LGMD R9 cases makes LGMD R9 a stronger fit, as pain insensitivity is not a typical feature of DMD."

      "explanation": "Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type R2 (LGMD R2) caused by CAPN3 mutations is one of the most common forms of LGMD and shares many clinical similarities with the patient's presentation, including proximal muscle weakness, Gowers sign, calf pseudohypertrophy, and elevated creatine kinase. However, the specific diagnosis in the reference cases (LGMD R9) and the consistent presence of 'pain insensitivity' in the patient and reference cases make LGMD R9 a more precise match, as pain insensitivity is not a characteristic feature of LGMD R2."

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.

      "explanation": "This disease is the most likely candidate, as it is the exact diagnosis in all three similar reference cases, which share a striking overlap of key phenotypic features with the patient. The patient presents with 'Frequent falls', 'Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes', 'Peripheral axonal neuropathy', and 'Acral ulceration', all of which are explicitly present in the reference cases. The patient's 'Spasticity' aligns with the 'Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes' and 'Scissor gait' (from reference cases), indicating an upper motor neuron component which is characteristic of certain forms or presentations of HSAN Type II. This robust overlap makes it the top candidate."

      "explanation": "Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia type 11 (SPG11) is a complicated form of HSP known to cause significant spasticity and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, directly matching two prominent features of the patient. Importantly, SPG11 can also involve peripheral neuropathy, which explains the patient's 'Peripheral axonal neuropathy'. While acral ulceration is not a primary feature of SPG11, it could occur secondary to severe sensory involvement in a complicated neuropathy. This disease is a strong candidate for explaining the combined upper motor neuron (spasticity, hyperreflexia) and peripheral nerve features."

      "explanation": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B (CMT2B) is an axonal form of CMT characterized by prominent sensory involvement, often leading to recurrent skin ulcers ('Acral ulceration') and osteomyelitis, which strongly matches one of the patient's key features. It also explains the 'Peripheral axonal neuropathy'. While spasticity and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes are less typical for most CMTs, some atypical presentations or specific gene mutations within the CMT spectrum can lead to combined upper and lower motor neuron signs. This disease is a good fit for the severe sensory neuropathy and its complications."

      "explanation": "Pallister-Hall syndrome is the most fitting diagnosis for this patient, sharing multiple hallmark features. These include the highly specific hypothalamic hamartoma, postaxial polydactyly, Y-shaped metacarpals, Y-shaped metatarsals, anal atresia, growth delay, intellectual disability, and nail dysplasia. This constellation of findings, particularly the rare skeletal and brain malformations, represents a near-perfect match with the patient's comprehensive phenotype. While the reference cases do not explicitly list hypothalamic hamartoma, they share a significant number of other critical features (polydactyly, Y-shaped metacarpals, anal atresia, intellectual disability, growth delay, nail dysplasia), suggesting they are also within the GLI3-related spectrum."

      "explanation": "Greig Cephalopolysyndactyly Syndrome (GCPS) is an allelic disorder to Pallister-Hall syndrome, both caused by mutations in the GLI3 gene, placing it within the same genetic and phenotypic spectrum. Although the patient does not present with the typical craniofacial features of classic GCPS (e.g., macrocephaly, hypertelorism, preaxial polydactyly, cutaneous syndactyly), there is significant overlap in other critical features such as postaxial polydactyly, Y-shaped metacarpals/metatarsals, intellectual disability, growth delay, and anal atresia (though rarer in GCPS than PHS). The provided reference cases, which share many of the patient's non-hamartoma features, exhibit strong classic GCPS characteristics, reinforcing the consideration of this GLI3-related condition due to the close phenotypic and genetic relationship."

It shares several significant features, including intellectual disability, postaxial polydactyly, and importantly, the highly specific Y-shaped metacarpals. KIF7 is a ciliary gene involved in the Sonic Hedgehog pathway, which provides a mechanistic link to GLI3-related disorders (Pallister-Hall and Greig Cephalopolysyndactyly syndromes). While the patient lacks typical acrocallosal features such as agenesis of the corpus callosum and characteristic facial dysmorphism, and hypothalamic hamartoma is not a common feature, its inclusion is warranted given the shared rare skeletal findings and broader category of ciliopathies with CNS and limb anomalies."

Other reported features such as autism, ADHD, motor delay, seizures, and ventriculomegaly are also consistent with the known spectrum of Sotos Syndrome 1.

ADHD, motor delay, and seizures are also consistent findings. While tall stature and prominent supraorbital ridges are less consistently reported hallmark features compared to Sotos Syndrome, the core neurodevelopmental presentation with specific sleep disturbances makes this a highly relevant consideration, fitting the 'Intellectual developmental disorder with autism and macrocephaly' pattern."

Overgrowth (potentially leading to tall stature) can also be seen in BRRS. However, prominent supraorbital ridges are not a classic facial feature, and other hallmark features of BRRS (e.g., lipomas, hemangiomas, pigmented macules) are not described in the patient's information.

      "disease_id": "OMIM:613849",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This is the most likely diagnosis due to a significant overlap of phenotypic features with the patient. The patient presents with Osteopenia, Delayed gross motor development, Recurrent fractures, Proptosis, Pes planus, and Diaphyseal undertubulation. All these specific features are explicitly mentioned in Reference Case 1 for Osteogenesis imperfecta, type IX, making it an almost perfect match. This type of OI is caused by mutations in the BMP1 gene, affecting bone mineralization and modeling."

    {
      "disease_name": "Osteogenesis imperfecta, type VI",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:610682",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Osteogenesis imperfecta, type VI, is a strong candidate. It is characterized by severe osteopenia, recurrent fractures, and bone modeling defects that can include undertubulation of diaphyses, similar to the patient's presentation. While Proptosis and Pes planus are not universally classic features, they can occur in the context of broader connective tissue involvement. This type is caused by mutations in SERPINF1 (encoding pigment epithelium-derived factor, PEDF) and is known for its distinctive bone biopsy findings (fishnet pattern)."

      "disease_name": "Osteogenesis imperfecta, type XV",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:617173",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "This type of Osteogenesis imperfecta is also a relevant consideration. Reference Case 2 for OI type XV shares key features with the patient, including Osteopenia, Recurrent fractures, and Motor delay (delayed gross motor development). Although other specific features like Diaphyseal undertubulation or Proptosis are not explicitly listed in Case 2 or as primary features of this specific OI type, WNT1 mutations (which cause OI type XV) are crucial for bone formation and can lead to severe bone fragility and variable skeletal deformities."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:614865",

      "explanation": "Osteogenesis imperfecta, type XIII, caused by TMEM38B mutations, is another severe recessive form of OI that fits the patient's general presentation of recurrent fractures, osteopenia, and delayed motor development. It is known to affect bone modeling, which could manifest as diaphyseal undertubulation. While less directly supported by the provided reference cases than type IX, it remains a plausible differential diagnosis within the spectrum of severe OI."

    {
      "disease_name": "Hypophosphatasia, childhood type",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:241500",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "Hypophosphatasia is an important differential diagnosis for osteopenia and recurrent fractures in childhood due to defective bone mineralization. While it explains the core features of bone fragility, the specific features of Diaphyseal undertubulation, Proptosis, Pes planus, Flat occiput, and Narrow chest are not typical of Hypophosphatasia. Additionally, characteristic biochemical findings like low alkaline phosphatase are not mentioned in the patient's data, making it less likely than OI types, but still a disease to rule out."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:618364",
      "score": 0.16,
      "explanation": "While this condition (Reference Case 3) shares Osteopenia and Motor delay with the patient, it lacks the defining features of recurrent fractures, proptosis, pes planus, and critically, diaphyseal undertubulation. The patient does not present with the specific limb anomalies (absent toe, syndactyly), cardiac defects, or distinct facial features typical of Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Guo-Campeau type. Therefore, it is considered a less likely diagnosis compared to the Osteogenesis Imperfecta spectrum."

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.

      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This specific subtype of common variable immunodeficiency is the exact diagnosis of all three provided reference cases, which share multiple key phenotypic features with the patient. These shared features include decreased CD4:CD8 ratio, B lymphocytopenia, decreased circulating IgA concentration, decreased circulating total IgM, and thrombocytopenia (which is frequently autoimmune in CVID). The patient's decreased proportion of class-switched memory B cells is also a hallmark finding consistent with CVID. While explicit low IgG levels are not listed for the patient, the 'variable' nature of CVID allows for diverse immunoglobulin profiles, and the strong overall phenotypic match with the reference cases makes this the most likely diagnosis."

The patient's features, including B lymphocytopenia, decreased proportion of class-switched memory B cells, decreased circulating IgA and IgM, thrombocytopenia, and an altered CD4:CD8 ratio, are highly consistent with the diagnostic criteria for CVID. CVID is characterized by impaired antibody production and hypogammaglobulinemia, often accompanied by autoimmune manifestations and altered lymphocyte subsets. This diagnosis is extremely likely, even if a specific genetic subtype (like CVID13) is not definitively confirmed."

      "explanation": "Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS) is considered due to the presence of thrombocytopenia (autoimmune cytopenias are a hallmark of ALPS) and the decreased CD4:CD8 ratio, which is often seen in ALPS due to an accumulation of double-negative T cells. While ALPS primarily involves defective lymphocyte apoptosis and lymphoproliferation (which is not explicitly mentioned in the patient's symptoms), some ALPS patients can develop secondary hypogammaglobulinemia. However, the prominent B cell abnormalities (B lymphocytopenia, decreased class-switched memory B cells, and specific IgA and IgM deficiencies) point more strongly towards a primary B cell immunodeficiency like CVID, making ALPS a less precise fit but a relevant differential diagnosis."

The presence of cerebellar atrophy/hypoplasia, hypotonia, delayed motor milestones (sitting, walking), and speech delay are all consistent with the neurological aspects of Gillespie syndrome.

However, it does not account for the distinct ocular findings (iris/foveal hypoplasia, visual impairment), and the patient lacks several dysmorphic features characteristic of SCAR20.

      "explanation": "While broader in its clinical spectrum, disorders caused by PAX6 mutations are well-known to present with the combination of iris hypoplasia (aniridia), foveal hypoplasia, nystagmus, and visual impairment. Importantly, some individuals with PAX6 mutations also exhibit central nervous system anomalies, including cerebellar hypoplasia/atrophy and intellectual disability, which aligns with the patient's neurological profile. It is a strong candidate for the ocular-neurological overlap, although Gillespie syndrome offers a more precise fit for the specific triad of aniridia, ataxia, and intellectual disability."

While it accounts for some musculoskeletal and ocular symptoms, the specific constellation of facial features (e.g., ectropion, telecanthus) and the widespread visceral diverticula (gastric, colonic, bladder) are less characteristic compared to Cutis laxa type ID. Additionally, severe hypotonia at birth is a common feature of kEDS-PLOD1 which is not mentioned for the patient, and accelerated skeletal maturation is not a typical finding."

However, several critical differentiating factors exist: Marfan syndrome typically presents with *delayed* skeletal maturation, whereas the patient has accelerated maturation. Furthermore, the extensive range of visceral diverticula and hernias (e.g., bladder, gastric, colonic, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, volvulus, rectal prolapse) are not classic features of Marfan syndrome, which is primarily characterized by cardiovascular (aortic) involvement, typically absent in the patient's reported phenotypes.

However, the defining characteristic of LDS is arterial tortuosity and aneurysms, which are not reported in the patient. Additionally, common craniofacial features of LDS often include hypertelorism, widely spaced eyes (opposite of telecanthus), and sometimes cleft palate or bifid uvula, which do not align with the patient's specific facial dysmorphology. The extensive GI/GU diverticula are also not prominent features of LDS."

This is strongly supported by Reference Case 1, which was diagnosed with SPG78 and shares numerous key features including Parkinsonism, Bradykinesia, Babinski sign, Hyperreflexia, and Cerebellar atrophy. SPG78 (due to DDHD2 mutations) is specifically characterized by this combination of spasticity, ataxia, and parkinsonism with an adult onset, fitting the patient's age of 27."

The patient's constellation of Parkinsonism, cerebellar atrophy with Romberg sign, and upper motor neuron signs fits the known clinical spectrum of MSA very well, making it a highly probable differential diagnosis. While typical onset is often later, early-onset cases do occur, making it relevant for a 27-year-old."

      "explanation": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (Machado-Joseph Disease, MJD) is the most common autosomal dominant SCA and is well-known for its highly variable clinical presentation. It frequently includes cerebellar ataxia (consistent with cerebellar atrophy and Romberg sign), parkinsonism, dystonia, and pyramidal signs (hyperreflexia, Babinski). The presence of both cerebellar atrophy and parkinsonian features, along with upper motor neuron signs, makes MJD a strong candidate for this patient's complex neurodegenerative phenotype, with an age of onset that typically spans from early adulthood."

      "explanation": "While prominent cerebellar features (atrophy, Romberg sign) are not typically the primary emphasis for Parkinson disease 15, this condition (caused by FBXO7 mutations) is known to present with early-onset parkinsonism that can include rigidity, bradykinesia, and notably, significant pyramidal signs such as hyperreflexia and Babinski sign. This is consistent with the patient's parkinsonian and upper motor neuron features and directly supported by Reference Cases 2 and 3. Its inclusion is warranted given the strong overlap in these core features from the provided reference cases."

Crucially, all three similar reference cases, which share these core features, were diagnosed as Immunodeficiency, common variable, 13 (NFKB1 deficiency). While the patient's record does not explicitly state 'Decreased circulating IgG concentration' (which was present in the reference cases), CVID, including type 13, is a heterogeneous disorder with variable immunoglobulin deficiencies, and presentations can include predominant IgA and IgM deficiencies, potentially progressing or presenting atypically regarding IgG."

It is frequently associated with decreased circulating IgA and IgM levels, B lymphocytopenia, and a reduction in class-switched memory B cells – all key features observed in the patient.

- Case 3: Presented with Axillary freckling, Inguinal freckling, Multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and Plexiform neurofibroma → Diagnosed as Neurofibromatosis, type 1 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.

Key features matching include CNS hypomyelination, brain atrophy, cerebellar atrophy, severe intellectual disability, spasticity, and short stature. Crucially, precocious puberty, an unusual but present feature in the patient, has been reported in a subset of VWMD patients, particularly those with EIF2B2 mutations. While hypsarrhythmia and infantile spasms may not be the initial presentation in all VWMD cases, severe epilepsy with various seizure types is commonly seen as part of the neurological deterioration. The progressive nature suggested by atrophy and hypomyelination further supports this diagnosis, making it the most likely candidate."

While DEE is a broad clinical category encompassing many genetic causes, the severe and refractory nature of the epilepsy, along with significant developmental impairment and brain structural abnormalities (atrophy, hypomyelination), is highly indicative of this diagnosis. The similar reference cases also directly point to 'Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 5' and 'Developmental delay with or without epilepsy', reinforcing this categorization. VWMD is a specific genetic cause that can manifest as a DEE."

These include CNS hypomyelination, brain atrophy (specifically basal ganglia and cerebellum, which aligns with generalized brain and cerebellar atrophy), spasticity, and intellectual disability. Seizures can occur in H-ABC, and short stature is sometimes reported. However, precocious puberty is not a typical feature of H-ABC, which makes VWMD a more comprehensive fit for the patient's entire constellation of symptoms."

Some types of AGS can mimic leukodystrophies. While there is overlap in severe neurological symptoms and brain imaging findings, primary CNS hypomyelination as described for this patient is less typical for AGS compared to true hypomyelinating leukodystrophies. More importantly, precocious puberty is not a characteristic feature of AGS, and the syndrome often involves other indicators of interferonopathy (e.g., basal ganglia calcifications, chilblains) that are not specified in the patient's features."

While it can cause neurological symptoms and metabolic derangements, the specific constellation of macrocephaly, recurrent subdural hemorrhage, and predominant dystonia without other common MADD features (like cardiomyopathy or severe liver involvement) makes it a less typical fit compared to type I. However, given the requirement to list additional potential diseases and the metabolic overlap in glutaric acid accumulation, it remains a distant differential diagnosis."

While the prominent facial weakness, ptosis, strabismus, dysarthria, and facial-lingual fasciculations are atypical for classical descriptions of dHMN11, there can be phenotypic variability and overlap within the spectrum of hereditary motor neuronopathies, and the patient's presentation might represent a more severe or extended phenotype of this condition, making it a highly relevant initial consideration given the strong guidance from similar cases."

This disease provides a comprehensive explanation for almost all of the patient's complex symptoms, especially the widespread nature of the neuropathy affecting both limbs and cranial nerves.

      "explanation": "ALS4 is a form of motor neuron disease with early childhood onset characterized by progressive lower motor neuron dysfunction. It readily explains the motor axonal neuropathy, distal amyotrophy, facial weakness, dysarthria, and critically, the facial-lingual fasciculations, which are a hallmark of motor neuron disease. The patient's delayed gross motor development, loss of ambulation, and progressive weakness are consistent with this diagnosis. While impaired vibratory sensation is less typical for a pure motor neuron disease, it can sometimes be a secondary finding or reflect a more complex neurodegenerative process."

Critically, precocious puberty in females, sensorineural hearing impairment, strabismus, poor coordination, and broad-based gait are all reported features of DDX3X syndrome, making it a highly compelling candidate that accounts for the less common features alongside the prominent neurological ones."

The high prevalence of this diagnosis in the similar reference cases further supports its relevance. While it explains the majority of the neurological symptoms, precocious puberty is not a typical feature of STXBP1 encephalopathy, making it a less complete fit compared to DDX3X syndrome, but still a very strong contender given the overall clinical picture."

While the numerical designation 'systemic 5' can sometimes refer to Fibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis (OMIM:105080, primarily renal), the combined presence of hepatic and renal amyloidosis in the reference cases and the patient strongly points to Transthyretin-related (ATTR) amyloidosis, which commonly involves both organs.

      "explanation": "This disorder, caused by STXBP1 gene variants, aligns strongly with the patient's core features including moderate global developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, microcephaly, delayed ability to walk and speech, and gastroesophageal reflux. It directly matches the diagnosis of reference Case 2, which presented with a highly similar constellation of neurodevelopmental and gastrointestinal symptoms, along with craniofacial features such as high forehead and prominent supraorbital ridges, consistent with the patient's high forehead and prominent metopic ridge.

Gastroesophageal reflux and short stature are also common findings. Dysmorphic features like a prominent forehead (aligning with the patient's high forehead and prominent metopic ridge) are frequently observed in affected individuals.

A key distinguishing feature that aligns well with the patient's presentation is the presence of a 'tented philtrum', which is a recognized dysmorphic feature in CSS. Other consistent features include prominent forehead and prominent metopic ridge."

While not a primary match for the specific triad of features, some individuals with CHARGE syndrome can present with endocrine dysfunction (such as hypoparathyroidism) and immune defects. However, specific thymic aplasia leading to T lymphocytopenia is not a hallmark feature as it is in DiGeorge syndrome, making this a much less likely but possible alternative in a comprehensive differential."

The specific combination of cleft ala nasi with widespread joint contractures (talipes equinovarus, camptodactyly) and the characteristic 'whistling-face' facies, including deeply set eyes, long philtrum, and depressed nasal bridge, are highly indicative of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, aligning perfectly with the features described in the patient and the first reference case."

It accounts for the patient's prominent limb features like Talipes equinovarus, Overlapping toe, and Camptodactyly, and can include general facial dysmorphism such as depressed nasal bridge and a flat face. While it does not specifically account for highly distinctive features like Cleft ala nasi or the precise combination of other facial features seen in the patient as well as Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, it remains a critical differential for patients presenting with multiple severe congenital contractures."

Furthermore, several key dysmorphic and metabolic features (like hyperlipidemia and specific facial features) observed in the patient and the reference cases are less typical for MIRAGE syndrome and more aligned with Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation.

Key features such as global developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, thin corpus callosum, cerebral atrophy, and spasticity are commonly observed. Critically, it also explains the challenging combination of short stature and obesity, which are prominent in the patient. A prominent nasal bridge is a reported dysmorphic feature.

      "explanation": "Prader-Willi Syndrome is a strong differential due to the presence of several core features: global developmental delay, intellectual disability, short stature, obesity (developing after infancy), and thin upper lip vermilion. Early hypotonia, a hallmark of PWS, can evolve into motor difficulties, including spasticity-like features, and seizures can occur. While prominent nasal bridge, thin corpus callosum, and cerebral atrophy are not classic primary features of PWS, brain imaging can show variable non-specific findings, and cerebral atrophy might be a secondary consequence of chronic neurological impairment or seizures. The strong match for the metabolic/growth and some facial features makes it highly relevant."

Characteristic facial features include a broad nasal bridge (consistent with prominent nasal bridge in the patient). Spasticity and inability to walk are also commonly seen. While short stature can be present, obesity and a thin upper lip vermilion are not typical features (patients often have full lips or typical weight). However, the profound neurodevelopmental phenotype with specific brain anomalies and prominent nasal bridge makes it a plausible candidate."

It is characterized by developmental delay or regression, hypotonia, spasticity, rigidity, seizures (often evolving into an epileptic encephalopathy), and characteristic brain abnormalities including cerebral atrophy and basal ganglia lesions. Optic atrophy and other visual impairments are common, which could manifest as an abnormal electroretinogram. While increased nuchal translucency is not a primary defining feature, severe mitochondrial disorders can have early fetal manifestations, and sudden unexpected death is a known complication. This provides a reasonable alternative given the broad neurological and developmental presentation."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:147920",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This syndrome presents a strong fit for a majority of the patient's phenotypic features. Key matches include intellectual disability, intrauterine growth retardation, feeding difficulties, clinodactyly, narrow palate, and characteristic abnormal facial shape. Crucially, prominent fingertip pads (often described as prominent fetal pads or prominent digital pads) and horseshoe kidney are recognized and frequently reported features in Kabuki Syndrome. While neonatal hypoglycemia is not a primary hallmark, it can occur in complex syndromic conditions, especially those with growth restriction and metabolic vulnerabilities. The overall pattern aligns well with the patient's presentation and the broader 'developmental delay, dysmorphic facies' described in the reference cases."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Kabuki Syndrome 2 (KDM6A-related)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:300867",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This subtype of Kabuki Syndrome shares a highly similar core phenotypic spectrum with Kabuki Syndrome 1, as both result in the Kabuki facies and associated multisystem anomalies. Therefore, it is also a very strong candidate. It accounts for the patient's intellectual disability, intrauterine growth retardation, feeding difficulties, clinodactyly, narrow palate, abnormal facial shape, prominent fingertip pads, and horseshoe kidney. Similar to Kabuki Syndrome 1, neonatal hypoglycemia is not a classic feature but does not rule out the diagnosis given the strong overall phenotypic match."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:617806",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "Coffin-Siris Syndrome, particularly the ARID1B-related form which is the most common genetic cause, is a compelling differential diagnosis. This syndrome frequently presents with intellectual disability, intrauterine growth retardation, feeding difficulties, and abnormal facial features. Prominent fingertip pads are described in some patients, especially in the context of variable digital anomalies, and renal anomalies including horseshoe kidney are reported. Clinodactyly and a high-arched palate are also consistent. Like Kabuki Syndrome, neonatal hypoglycemia is not a common or primary feature of Coffin-Siris Syndrome, but the extensive overlap in other key dysmorphic and developmental features makes it a highly probable cause."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Coffin-Siris Syndrome 1 (SMARCB1-related)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:135900",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This is another established genetic subtype of Coffin-Siris Syndrome. It presents with a phenotype largely overlapping with other Coffin-Siris forms, including intellectual disability, intrauterine growth retardation, feeding difficulties, dysmorphic facial features, and the possibility of prominent fingertip pads, clinodactyly, and horseshoe kidney. While neonatal hypoglycemia is not a defining feature, the overall constellation of congenital anomalies and developmental issues aligns well with the patient's profile."

      "disease_name": "Coffin-Siris Syndrome 2 (SMARCA4-related)",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:617804",
      "score": 0.2,
      "explanation": "As with other genetic causes of Coffin-Siris Syndrome, the SMARCA4-related type exhibits features highly relevant to the patient's presentation, such as intellectual disability, intrauterine growth retardation, feeding difficulties, characteristic facial dysmorphism, and a spectrum of congenital anomalies that can include prominent fingertip pads, clinodactyly, and horseshoe kidney. The absence of consistently reported neonatal hypoglycemia is noted, but the strong concordance with multiple other, particularly unique, phenotypic features supports its inclusion as a potential diagnosis."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Silver-Russell Syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:180860",
      "score": 0.166,
      "explanation": "Silver-Russell Syndrome is a strong contender primarily due to two hallmark features present in the patient: intrauterine growth retardation and neonatal hypoglycemia, which is a common metabolic finding in this syndrome. Other matching features include intellectual disability (often mild to moderate), feeding difficulties, and clinodactyly. Horseshoe kidney has also been reported. However, prominent fingertip pads are not a classic or frequently described feature of Silver-Russell Syndrome, making it a slightly less precise fit compared to Kabuki or Coffin-Siris syndromes in explaining all specific morphological features."

      "explanation": "This syndrome, caused by germline mutations in SMARCB1, predisposes individuals to highly aggressive tumors, including atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) of the brain. Importantly, rare cases of familial choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs), which cause villous hypertrophy of the choroid plexus and subsequent hydrocephalus due to CSF overproduction, have been linked to SMARCB1 mutations. Intellectual disability and global developmental delay are common features due to neurological involvement. While specific facial dysmorphisms are not hallmark, the unique combination of hydrocephalus and villous hypertrophy of choroid plexus makes this a strong candidate."

Patients commonly present with intellectual disability, global developmental delay, and visual impairment (e.g., retinal hamartomas or optic atrophy secondary to hydrocephalus). Hydrocephalus can occur due to obstruction of CSF flow by subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). While villous hypertrophy of the choroid plexus is not a typical hallmark, the general hamartomatous nature and brain involvement leading to hydrocephalus, combined with ID and visual issues, make it a strong differential."

It is associated with hamartomatous overgrowth in multiple tissues, macrocephaly (which can sometimes lead to hydrocephalus), and increased risk of various tumors. Intellectual disability and developmental delay are recognized neurological features. Although villous hypertrophy of the choroid plexus is not a classic feature, PTEN mutations have been implicated in some sporadic cases of choroid plexus papillomas, and the overarching theme of hamartoma formation aligns with the choroid plexus findings."

      "explanation": "This X-linked disorder, often called X-linked hydrocephalus with stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius (HSAS), is caused by mutations in the L1CAM gene. It is a primary cause of severe congenital hydrocephalus, typically affecting males (consistent with the patient's Gender 1 designation). Intellectual disability and global developmental delay are prominent features. While it explains hydrocephalus, ID, and GDD very well, it typically involves aqueductal stenosis rather than villous hypertrophy of the choroid plexus. High myopia is also not a primary feature, though visual impairment can result from hydrocephalus."

While SCA15 is primarily considered a pure cerebellar ataxia, hyperreflexia can be present.

      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This is the most likely diagnosis due to the strong overlap of the patient's core features—microcephaly, intellectual disability, global developmental delay, feeding difficulties, chronic constipation, delayed motor and speech development, sleep abnormality, recurrent infections, hypertonia, and prominently, long eyelashes—with the classic presentation of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS). Furthermore, the extensive phenotypic lists in reference cases 2 and 3, which share many of the patient's primary features (Microcephaly, ID, GDD, Long eyelashes, Sleep abnormality, Constipation, Recurrent infections), contain numerous additional dysmorphic features highly characteristic of CdLS, providing strong correlative evidence. Mutations in NIPBL are the most common cause of CdLS."

Given the patient's constellation of features, this subtype warrants consideration, especially if the more striking dysmorphic features commonly associated with NIPBL-CdLS are subtle or not extensively documented."

      "explanation": "CdLS due to SMC1A mutations presents with many features overlapping with NIPBL-related CdLS, including intellectual disability, developmental delay, microcephaly, and long eyelashes. It is an X-linked dominant form, primarily affecting females or having variable phenotypes in males. This subtype should be considered in the differential diagnosis given the patient's male sex and core features, as it falls within the broader CdLS spectrum."

Phenotypically, it shares the cardinal features of intellectual disability, developmental delay, and often microcephaly and growth retardation. While less common, its inclusion is justified by the strong overall phenotypic resemblance to the CdLS spectrum observed in the patient."

While long eyelashes are not a typical feature, the severe neurodevelopmental phenotype with prominent motor involvement makes this a relevant differential diagnosis for the patient's condition."

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

      "explanation": "This diagnosis perfectly aligns with all major phenotypic features: short telomere length, severe pulmonary fibrosis (Usual interstitial pneumonia, decreased DLCO, inspiratory crackles, clubbing), extensive hepatic manifestations (hepatic failure, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, portal hypertension, gastric varix, esophageal varix, splenomegaly), and thrombocytopenia. The reference cases were specifically diagnosed with 'Pulmonary fibrosis and/or bone marrow failure syndrome, telomere-related, 8,' which strongly implicates *RTEL1* as a causative gene, known for this multisystem phenotype including prominent liver disease (nodular regenerative hyperplasia) and pulmonary fibrosis."

Hepatic involvement, including nodular regenerative hyperplasia, portal hypertension, and hepatic failure, is also well-documented in *TERT*-related telomeropathies.

The phenotype includes progressive bone marrow failure (thrombocytopenia), pulmonary fibrosis (UIP), and severe liver disease, including nodular regenerative hyperplasia and portal hypertension, all of which are present in the patient. Although X-linked, affected females (gender 2) can present due to skewed X-inactivation or milder phenotypes, making it a plausible diagnosis given the comprehensive match of organ involvement."

      "explanation": "This disease is the most likely candidate as it directly aligns with the diagnoses from two highly similar reference cases. The patient's presentation of infantile spasms, focal motor seizures, EEG with focal epileptiform discharges and hypsarrhythmia, combined with severe global developmental delay, inability to walk, and absent speech, strongly matches the clinical features of Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 4 (often associated with STXBP1 gene mutations)."

      "explanation": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a well-known cause of symptomatic infantile spasms and global developmental delay, often due to cortical tubers that act as epileptogenic foci. While no other specific signs of TSC were provided, it is a common etiology for this severe epileptic encephalopathy phenotype. TSC2 is generally associated with more severe neurological manifestations than TSC1."

More importantly, the extensive clinical features listed in the similar reference cases (including postaxial and preaxial polydactyly, syndactyly, macrocephaly, hypertelorism, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, nail dysplasia, Y-shaped metacarpals, growth delay, and anal atresia) are highly characteristic of Pallister-Hall Syndrome.

Its core features include polysyndactyly (encompassing both preaxial and postaxial types) and syndactyly, which directly match the patient's presented features. While it doesn't account for all the specific features of the reference cases (like anal atresia or nail dysplasia), it shares genetic commonality (GLI3 gene) with Pallister-Hall Syndrome and explains other overlapping features such as macrocephaly and hypertelorism, making it a very plausible diagnosis given the patient's primary limb anomalies."

      "explanation": "This condition is listed as the diagnosis for the similar reference cases. However, the patient specifically presents with preaxial foot polydactyly, not postaxial. Although the reference cases did exhibit 'Preaxial polydactyly' as a feature, the official OMIM:174200 entry primarily describes isolated postaxial polydactyly and does not encompass the broad range of systemic features (e.g., intellectual disability, anal atresia, Y-shaped metacarpals) seen in the reference cases. This suggests that the reference case diagnosis might be a simplified description of a more complex syndromic presentation. Given the patient's specific preaxial involvement and the broader reference phenotype, this diagnosis is less precise as a primary fit but is included due to its explicit mention in the reference guidance."

      "explanation": "This is the most likely diagnosis, strongly supported by the striking phenotypic overlap with the similar reference cases (Case 2 and 3), both of which were diagnosed with Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 4 (caused by STXBP1 mutations). The patient exhibits the core features of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, multifocal epileptiform discharges, global developmental delay, infantile axial hypotonia, and various focal and generalized seizure types, all highly characteristic of this severe epileptic encephalopathy. While relative macrocephaly is not a universal feature, it has been reported in some individuals with STXBP1-related disorders and does not exclude the diagnosis given the overwhelming match of other key features."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Given the patient's male gender (Gender: 1), X-linked disorders are a relevant consideration. Mutations in the ARX gene cause X-linked infantile spasms syndrome, characterized by early-onset infantile spasms, severe global developmental delay, hypotonia, and a spectrum of brain malformations (e.g., lissencephaly, pachygyria) which can contribute to macrocephaly and the severe seizure phenotype, aligning well with the patient's presentation."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:602501",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This syndrome, primarily caused by PIK3CA mutations, is a strong candidate as it directly accounts for the combination of megalencephaly (macrocephaly), global developmental delay, and a high incidence of intractable epilepsy, including infantile spasms. While capillary malformations are a hallmark feature, their absence from the listed clinical data does not entirely rule out the diagnosis, as phenotypic expression can vary or not all features may be documented at initial assessment."

    {
      "disease_name": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:191100",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex is a significant cause of infantile spasms, often presenting as the initial symptom in affected infants. It also frequently leads to other seizure types, global developmental delay, and can rarely be associated with macrocephaly. While the classic systemic features (e.g., hypomelanotic macules, facial angiofibromas, cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, renal angiomyolipomas) are not listed, the core neurological and seizure phenotype warrants its inclusion in the differential diagnosis given the prominence of infantile spasms."

The hallmark hypoplasia of distal phalanges and nails (brachydactyly) is a strong match, and joint hypermobility and autistic behavior are also commonly observed.

Joint hypermobility is also noted in CdLS. However, the nasal features in classic CdLS are typically described as small with an upturned tip and depressed nasal bridge, which is less consistent with the patient's wide nose and thick nasal alae. Also, the thick lower lip vermilion is less typical for CdLS. Despite these differences, the considerable overlap in other key dysmorphic and neurodevelopmental features warrants its inclusion as a differential diagnosis. Other subtypes of CdLS (e.g., CdLS2-5) should also be considered."

The resulting hypercortisolism can lead to hypogonadism, accounting for 'Decreased serum testosterone concentration'. While not a primary feature, pituitary adenomas causing Cushing's can sometimes co-secrete prolactin or, if large, cause stalk compression leading to 'Increased circulating prolactin concentration'. This makes it a plausible differential diagnosis, as it can encompass all three phenotypic features, although the consistent presence of low cortisol in the reference cases for 21-hydroxylase deficiency (not explicitly stated for the patient) makes Cushing's a less direct fit without further cortisol data."

- Case 3: Presented with Sensorineural hearing impairment, Delayed speech and language development, and Abnormal facial shape → Diagnosed as Deafness, autosomal recessive 125 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.

Key overlapping features include Apnea, Vomiting, Retinal degeneration, Congestive heart failure with severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, Cholelithiasis, Feeding difficulties, Global developmental delay, Developmental regression, Failure to thrive, CNS demyelination, and Cerebral edema. Crucially, the patient also presents with decreased activity of mitochondrial complex I, complex IV, and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, all of which are characteristic of a combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency like COXPD59 (which is caused by mutations in FARS2 and is known to affect multiple mitochondrial functions including those of complex IV and PDH, and often indirectly complex I)."

      "explanation": "The patient explicitly demonstrates decreased activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, making PDH deficiency a significant finding. While the presence of decreased complex I and IV activity suggests a broader combined OXPHOS defect, primary PDH deficiency itself can cause severe neurological (developmental delay, regression, CNS demyelination, cerebral edema), cardiac, and systemic symptoms that overlap with the patient's presentation.

      "explanation": "This mitochondrial disorder shares some common features with the patient such as global developmental delay, failure to thrive, and vomiting. It is listed as a reference case (Case 3) for guidance on mitochondrial disorders. However, the patient's prominent cardiac dysfunction (congestive heart failure, severe LV ejection fraction reduction), retinal degeneration, specific isolated complex I and IV deficiencies, CNS demyelination, and cerebral edema are not as consistently characteristic of MDDS6, which typically features more significant primary hepatic involvement (e.g., hepatic failure, cirrhosis, cholestasis) that is not reported in the patient."

The patient's neurological symptoms, including global developmental delay, developmental regression, CNS demyelination, and cerebral edema, align well with the phenotypic spectrum of Leigh syndrome. While Leigh syndrome is a clinical phenotype with various genetic causes (and Combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 59 can present with a Leigh-like phenotype), it remains a plausible, albeit less specific, diagnostic consideration given the underlying mitochondrial dysfunction."

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: 
- Gender: 2

Phenotypic Features:

- Decreased serum testosterone concentration (HP:0040171)
- Increased circulating ACTH level (HP:0003154)
- Decreased circulating cortisol level (HP:0008163)
- Increased circulating prolactin concentration (HP:0000870)
- Increased serum estradiol (HP:0025134)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Decreased serum testosterone concentration, Increased circulating ACTH level, Abnormality of circulating cortisol level, Increased circulating prolactin concentration, and Abnormal serum estradiol → Diagnosed as Adrenal hyperplasia, congenital, due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Decreased serum testosterone concentration, Abnormal circulating adrenocorticotropin concentration, Abnormality of circulating cortisol level, Increased circulating prolactin concentration, and Abnormal serum estradiol → Diagnosed as Adrenal hyperplasia, congenital, due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Abnormal circulating testosterone concentration, Abnormal circulating adrenocorticotropin concentration, Decreased circulating cortisol level, Increased circulating prolactin concentration, and Abnormal serum estradiol → Diagnosed as Adrenal hyperplasia, congenital, due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Furthermore, all three provided similar reference cases present with a very similar constellation of features, including decreased serum testosterone concentration, abnormal/increased circulating prolactin, and abnormal/increased serum estradiol, and are specifically diagnosed as Adrenal hyperplasia, congenital, due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

      "disease_id": "OMIM:240300",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), also known as APECED, frequently includes autoimmune adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) as a key component. This would directly account for the increased circulating ACTH level and decreased circulating cortisol level. While the specific sex steroid profile (decreased serum testosterone, increased serum estradiol) and increased circulating prolactin concentration are not primary defining features of Addison's disease itself, complex endocrine dysregulation is common in multisystem autoimmune disorders like APS-1. For instance, primary ovarian insufficiency (a recognized component of APS-1) could lead to altered sex steroid profiles, and secondary effects or co-occurring autoimmune conditions might contribute to prolactin elevation. It represents a plausible alternative for primary adrenal insufficiency, though less directly aligned with the specific sex steroid and prolactin profile as demonstrated by the reference cases for 21-hydroxylase deficiency."

Other overlapping features can include ataxia, spastic paraparesis, and sensorimotor neuropathy.

However, it is described as 'congenital nonprogressive,' which contradicts the patient's age (P63Y) and implied progressive nature (Progressive visual loss, Loss of ambulation), and it does not account for a significant number of the patient's other key symptoms like Apraxia, Spastic paraparesis, Sensorimotor neuropathy, Optic atrophy, Cognitive impairment, and especially Increased CSF lactate.

      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Noonan Syndrome and related RASopathies are highly suspected due to the striking combination of features. The patient exhibits global developmental delay, hypotonia, hearing impairment, finger clinodactyly, and recurrent infections, all common in Noonan spectrum disorders. Key distinguishing features such as 'eversion of lateral third of lower eyelids' and 'prominent fingertip pads' are highly characteristic of Noonan syndrome. While pulmonary valve stenosis is more classic, aortic valve stenosis is a known cardiac manifestation. Wide nasal bridge and macrotia are also observed in the Noonan phenotype. OMIM:163950 represents the most common PTPN11-related Noonan Syndrome."

It is characterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, hearing impairment, prominent fingertip pads, finger clinodactyly, and various cardiac defects including aortic stenosis. Recurrent infections, wide nasal bridge, and macrotia can also be present. While the eyelid eversion might be less specific to CFC than Noonan, the overall constellation of features makes it a strong candidate. OMIM:115150 represents BRAF-related CFC syndrome."

Cardiac involvement, including aortic valve disease, and recurrent infections are well-documented features. Macrotia (large ears) is also characteristic. Although facial coarseness might differ, the substantial overlap in neurodevelopmental, cardiac, and limb findings makes Costello syndrome a plausible diagnosis within the RASopathy spectrum. OMIM:218040 represents HRAS-related Costello syndrome."

However, several distinctive features of the patient, such as eversion of lateral third of lower eyelids, prominent fingertip pads, and specifically aortic valve stenosis, are not typical or primary manifestations of White-Sutton syndrome, making it a less precise fit compared to the RASopathies."

The provided similar reference cases directly support this diagnosis, as all three cases presenting with these features were diagnosed as PHP-Ia.

      "explanation": "Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP) shares the exact same phenotypic features of Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) as PHP-Ia, including Obesity, Short metacarpal, and Intellectual disability. The key difference lies in the absence of the biochemical abnormalities (hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, elevated PTH) seen in PHP-Ia. Since no biochemical data for the patient is provided, PPHP remains a very strong differential diagnosis, as both conditions are caused by mutations in the GNAS gene, with parental imprinting determining the specific clinical presentation."

While the precise molecular defect leading to PTH resistance differs slightly from PHP-Ia, the common phenotypic expression of AHO makes it a relevant consideration, aligning with the patient's observed features."

While short metacarpals are not a cardinal sign, mild hand and foot anomalies are sometimes noted in PWS. It is a significant differential given the presence of obesity and intellectual disability, though the specificity of the 'short metacarpal' points more strongly towards the PHP spectrum."

It also overlaps with the dental anomalies seen in the patient (delayed eruption of teeth). While genetically distinct (caused by ZMPSTE24 mutations), its clinical presentation is very similar to Type A and warrants consideration in the differential diagnosis of a patient with progeroid features and lipodystrophy."

This diagnosis is strongly supported by all three provided reference cases, which exhibit a very similar constellation of features, including aniridia and cerebellar ataxia, and were specifically diagnosed with Spinocerebellar ataxia 29.

      "explanation": "This disease is highly consistent with the patient's core phenotypic features, including severe bone overgrowth leading to 'Cortical thickening of long bone diaphyses', 'Narrowing of medullary canal', and generalized 'Hyperostosis'. It also explains 'Bone pain', 'Shoulder pain', 'Waddling gait', and cranial involvement such as 'Prominent forehead', 'Proptosis', and 'Ptosis' due to nerve compression or orbital narrowing. While hypocalcemia is more typical of autosomal recessive forms, it can occur, and elevated alkaline phosphatase is also possible. The age of 35 years is more consistent with an autosomal dominant form."

      "disease_name": "Osteopetrosis, autosomal recessive 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:259700",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "This severe form of osteopetrosis strongly accounts for the profound bone density abnormalities such as 'Cortical thickening of long bone diaphyses', 'Narrowing of medullary canal', and 'Hyperostosis'. Crucially, 'Hypocalcemia' and 'Elevated circulating alkaline phosphatase concentration' are very characteristic features of this specific type of osteopetrosis, reflecting impaired bone resorption and potential rickets-like changes. Cranial features like 'Prominent forehead', 'Proptosis', and 'Ptosis' are also well-explained by bone overgrowth. While often manifesting in infancy, milder or late-onset presentations cannot be entirely ruled out, and the unique combination of hypocalcemia with osteosclerosis is highly suggestive."

      "disease_name": "Craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal dominant",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:123000",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This disease, referenced in the similar cases, shares several features with the patient, including 'Elevated circulating alkaline phosphatase concentration', 'Hyperostosis' (especially cranial and facial, manifesting as 'Prominent forehead'), and symptoms like 'Proptosis' and 'Ptosis' which can arise from cranial nerve compression due to bone overgrowth. It also causes 'Bone pain' and 'Shoulder pain'. However, it is less typical for 'Hypocalcemia' and its classic long bone involvement is 'Flared metaphysis' (as seen in reference cases) rather than the pronounced 'Cortical thickening of long bone diaphyses' and 'Narrowing of medullary canal' observed in this patient. Despite these differences, significant phenotypic overlap warrants its consideration."

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P5Y
- Gender: 0

Phenotypic Features:

- Anemia (HP:0001903)
- Thrombocytopenia (HP:0001873)
- Pancytopenia (HP:0001876)
- Neutropenia (HP:0001875)
- Short stature (HP:0004322)
- Cafe-au-lait spot (HP:0000957)
- Absent thumb (HP:0009777)
- Absent radius (HP:0003974)
- Chromosomal breakage induced by crosslinking agents (HP:0003221)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Chromosomal breakage induced by crosslinking agents, Absent thumb, Short stature, and Leukemia → Diagnosed as Fanconi anemia, complementation group C (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Anemia, Pancytopenia, Cafe-au-lait spot, Hypopigmented macule, Bone marrow hypocellularity, Chromosomal breakage induced by crosslinking agents, Anterior wedging of T12, Short thumb, Absent thumb, Duplication of thumb phalanx, Absent radius, and Short stature → Diagnosed as Fanconi anemia, complementation group C (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Short stature, Cafe-au-lait spot, Bone marrow hypocellularity, Triangular face, Ventricular septal defect, Intrauterine growth retardation, Chromosomal breakage induced by crosslinking agents, Short thumb, Absent thumb, Duplication of thumb phalanx, and Absent radius → Diagnosed as Fanconi anemia, complementation group C (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

      "explanation": "This is the most likely diagnosis. All of the patient's phenotypic features, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, short stature, cafe-au-lait spots, absent thumb, absent radius, and crucially, chromosomal breakage induced by crosslinking agents, are classic manifestations of Fanconi anemia. The reference cases directly link these features to Fanconi anemia, complementation group C, especially the highly diagnostic chromosomal breakage test."

      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "The patient's phenotype is highly consistent with Fanconi anemia as a broad diagnosis, characterized by progressive bone marrow failure, diverse congenital anomalies (especially radial ray defects and short stature), and characteristic chromosomal instability. While complementation group C is strongly suggested by the reference cases, Fanconi anemia is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, and other complementation groups could present similarly."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:274000",
      "score": 0.33,
      "explanation": "This syndrome is considered due to the presence of thrombocytopenia and absent radius, which are shared features. However, it is a significantly less likely diagnosis as it typically does not involve pancytopenia (often only isolated thrombocytopenia), anemia, neutropenia, cafe-au-lait spots, or the pathognomonic chromosomal breakage induced by crosslinking agents, which is a key diagnostic feature in the patient's presentation. Its inclusion is primarily to fulfill the requirement of listing more than one potential disease, despite low confidence."

      "explanation": "This is the most likely diagnosis. The patient's phenotypic features, including Achilles tendon contracture, gait disturbance, spinal rigidity, arrhythmia, scapuloperoneal amyotrophy, proximal muscle weakness in upper limbs, and stiff neck, are highly consistent with the classic triad of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD): early contractures, progressive muscle weakness, and cardiac involvement. All provided reference cases, presenting with highly similar features, were diagnosed with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 2, autosomal dominant, which is caused by mutations in the LMNA gene and commonly manifests with these symptoms."

      "explanation": "While the reference cases point to an autosomal dominant form, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 1 (X-linked), caused by mutations in the EMD gene, presents with an almost identical clinical picture including contractures (especially Achilles tendon and spinal rigidity), progressive muscle weakness (often scapuloperoneal), and cardiac conduction defects/arrhythmias.

There is significant phenotypic overlap between LMNA-related laminopathies, which often present with a spectrum of features including progressive limb-girdle weakness, early contractures (such as Achilles tendon and spinal rigidity), and prominent cardiac involvement (arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy). The patient's symptoms fit well within this overlapping spectrum."

      "explanation": "This syndrome aligns remarkably well with all the patient's listed phenotypic features: tall stature, obesity, macrocephaly, and a high forehead (often described as prominent or broad forehead in this context). It was also the specific diagnosis given in a highly similar reference case (Case 3) which presented with an overlapping phenotype including these core features. While intellectual disability is a common feature of Rabin-Pappas syndrome and is not explicitly stated for the patient, phenotypic variability exists, and the strong physical feature match makes it the most likely candidate."

Obesity can also be an associated feature. The primary divergence is the lack of stated intellectual disability or developmental delay, which are hallmark features of Sotos syndrome.

Facial features often include a broad forehead, which aligns with the patient's high forehead. Similar to Sotos syndrome, intellectual disability is typically a core feature but is not listed for the patient. Despite this, the physical presentation is a strong match."

While not as consistently central as in dedicated overgrowth syndromes, increased BMI/obesity and tall stature can be associated findings. The macrocephaly is a strong match, and the other features, though less specific, are not contradictory, making it a plausible consideration."

      "explanation": "This condition, also known as ReNU syndrome, is an extremely strong match for the patient's phenotype. Almost all of the patient's distinct features are observed in patients with ReNU syndrome, including global developmental delay, intellectual disability, progressive microcephaly, absent speech, motor delay, autistic behavior, motor stereotypy, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, gait disturbance, and characteristic craniofacial dysmorphism (open mouth, tented upper lip vermilion, tented philtrum, epicanthus, facial hypotonia, triangular face, bifid nasal tip, blepharophimosis, blue sclerae, broad nasal tip, high forehead, depressed nasal bridge, high palate, narrow palate, small earlobe). Furthermore, the presence of thin nails, thickened nuchal skin fold, gastroesophageal reflux, strabismus, nystagmus, astigmatism, pes planus, and a ventricular septal defect provides an almost perfect match. This is strongly supported by the provided similar reference cases (Case 1 and Case 2) which are diagnosed with ReNU syndrome and share an extensive number of identical features with the patient."

It shares some overlapping features with the patient, such as global developmental delay, intellectual disability (though variable), thickened nuchal skin fold (especially in neonates), pes planus, gastroesophageal reflux, strabismus, high palate, and a ventricular septal defect. However, many of the patient's specific and distinctive dysmorphic features (e.g., blepharophimosis, blue sclerae, bifid nasal tip, tented upper lip vermilion, tented philtrum, thin nail, progressive microcephaly, and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum) are not typical for Noonan syndrome. The overall facial gestalt of Noonan syndrome (e.g., hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, ptosis, low-set posteriorly rotated ears) also differs significantly from the patient's description. Therefore, while there is some overlap, it is a much less precise match compared to ReNU syndrome."

All key phenotypic features of the patient (Microcephaly, Postaxial hand polydactyly, Chiari type II malformation, Lumbosacral meningocele, and Talipes equinovarus) are highly consistent with the known spectrum of Meckel-Gruber Syndrome, which is a lethal ciliopathy and genetically heterogeneous (e.g., MKS1, TMEM67, RPGRIP1L, CEP290, CC2D2A, etc.)."

While Chiari type II malformation and meningocele are not the most typical CNS findings, severe brain malformations and neural tube defects can occur within the broad phenotypic spectrum of JSRD. There is significant clinical and genetic overlap with Meckel-Gruber Syndrome, with some severe JSRD cases resembling MKS.

The patient's presentation with postaxial hand polydactyly, microcephaly, Chiari type II malformation, lumbosacral meningocele, and talipes equinovarus aligns well with the digital and neurological features of this syndrome, which is also a ciliopathy.

      "explanation": "This disease is the diagnosis for two of the provided similar reference cases (Case 1 and Case 2) and shows a very high degree of phenotypic overlap with the patient's features. Key overlapping features include Intellectual disability, Global developmental delay, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Microcephaly, Motor delay, Feeding difficulties, Triangular face, Thick eyebrow, and Long philtrum. While Macrodontia, Short stature, and Intrauterine growth retardation are not always cardinal features, they can be variable manifestations or comorbidities in this syndromic presentation, making this the most likely diagnosis based on the strong overall gestalt and direct matches with similar cases."

Intellectual disability and ADHD can also be seen. However, the patient's Microcephaly is less typical for Silver-Russell Syndrome, which often presents with relative macrocephaly or a normal head circumference. Additionally, thick eyebrows and a long philtrum are not characteristic features of SRS, differentiating it from the primary candidate, but it remains a relevant differential for growth restriction phenotypes."

However, the most significant differentiating factor is the key feature of Macrocephaly in this disorder, which directly contradicts the patient's presentation of Microcephaly. Despite this contradiction, it is included as a potential diagnosis due to its presence in a similar reference case for other shared developmental symptoms, albeit with low confidence."

However, it lacks many of the highly specific and characteristic features observed in the patient, such as small nails, brachydactyly, mesomelia, broad thumb, symphalangism, specific craniofacial anomalies (short nose, anteverted nares, triangular mouth, frontal bossing), and micropenis. Therefore, it is considered a much less likely diagnosis compared to Robinow syndrome."

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P3Y
- Gender: 0

Phenotypic Features:

- Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (HP:0034401)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor → Diagnosed as Rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome 1 (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor → Diagnosed as Rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome 1 (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor → Diagnosed as Rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome 1 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

```json
{
  "ranked_diseases": [
    {
      "disease_name": "DiseaseName",
      "disease_id": "DiseaseID",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Brief explanation."
    }
  ]

      "disease_id": "OMIM:601358",
      "score": 1.0,
      "explanation": "This syndrome aligns remarkably well with all the patient's reported phenotypic features: hypotonia, global developmental delay, short stature, deeply set eyes, and brachycephaly. Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome, caused by mutations in SMARCA2, is characterized by severe developmental delay, short stature, and distinctive facial features including microcephaly/brachycephaly and deeply set eyes."

      "disease_name": "Coffin-Siris syndrome 1",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:614609",
      "score": 0.5,
      "explanation": "Coffin-Siris syndrome, particularly type 1 (due to ARID1B mutations), presents with significant overlap in symptoms. It commonly features hypotonia, global developmental delay, short stature, and brachycephaly. While specific digital anomalies are characteristic, deeply set eyes can also be a component of the variable facial dysmorphism. This syndrome shares a genetic pathway (BAF chromatin remodeling complex) with Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome, explaining the phenotypic similarities."

      "disease_id": "OMIM:618366",
      "score": 0.333,
      "explanation": "This disorder, caused by mutations in PPP2R1A, is directly referenced in two similar cases (Case 1 and 3) and matches several of the patient's key features, including hypotonia, global developmental delay, and deeply set eyes. However, the patient's short stature and brachycephaly are not consistently reported as primary features of this condition (microcephaly or macrocephaly may be seen instead)."
    },
    {
      "disease_name": "Smith-Magenis syndrome",
      "disease_id": "OMIM:182290",
      "score": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Smith-Magenis syndrome frequently includes hypotonia, global developmental delay, and brachycephaly, with variable short stature. While deeply set eyes are not a hallmark feature and other distinctive facial characteristics (e.g., broad face, prominent forehead, synophrys) are not listed for the patient, the presence of the other core features makes it a plausible, albeit less specific, consideration."
