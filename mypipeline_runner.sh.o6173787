Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

=== Prompt ===
You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P30Y
- Gender: 1

Phenotypic Features:

- Ataxia (HP:0001251)
- Hyporeflexia (HP:0001265)
- Supranuclear gaze palsy (HP:0000605)
- Dysarthria (HP:0001260)
- Athetosis (HP:0002305)
- Hypoalbuminemia (HP:0003073)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Ataxia, Hyporeflexia, Supranuclear gaze palsy, Dysarthria, and Athetosis → Diagnosed as Ataxia, early-onset, with oculomotor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Ataxia, Hyporeflexia, Supranuclear gaze palsy, Dysarthria, and Athetosis → Diagnosed as Ataxia, early-onset, with oculomotor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Ataxia, Hyporeflexia, Supranuclear gaze palsy, Dysarthria, Athetosis, Hypercholesterolemia, and Hypoalbuminemia → Diagnosed as Ataxia, early-onset, with oculomotor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

- Case 3: Presented with Intellectual disability, Macrodontia, Abnormality of the hand, Short stature, and Delayed skeletal maturation → Diagnosed as KBG syndrome (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P15Y
- Gender: 2

Phenotypic Features:

- Nyctalopia (HP:0000662)
- Postaxial polydactyly (HP:0100259)
- Ptosis (HP:0000508)
- Astigmatism (HP:0000483)
- Reduced visual acuity (HP:0007663)
- Obesity (HP:0001513)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Postaxial polydactyly, Reduced visual acuity, Nyctalopia, Intellectual disability, Obesity, Scoliosis, Cataract, and Myopia → Diagnosed as Bardet-Biedl syndrome 1 (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Postaxial polydactyly, Reduced visual acuity, Nyctalopia, Intellectual disability, Obesity, Scoliosis, Cataract, and Myopia → Diagnosed as Bardet-Biedl syndrome 1 (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Postaxial polydactyly, Myopia, Reduced visual acuity, Nyctalopia, Scoliosis, Cataract, Intellectual disability, and Obesity → Diagnosed as Bardet-Biedl syndrome 1 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

- Gender: 2

Phenotypic Features:

- Plexiform neurofibroma (HP:0009732)
- Freckling (HP:0001480)
- Multiple cafe-au-lait spots (HP:0007565)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Freckling, Multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and Plexiform neurofibroma → Diagnosed as Neurofibromatosis, type 1 (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Multiple cafe-au-lait spots, Plexiform neurofibroma, Freckling, and Scoliosis → Diagnosed as Neurofibromatosis, type 1 (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Axillary freckling, Inguinal freckling, Multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and Plexiform neurofibroma → Diagnosed as Neurofibromatosis, type 1 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.

- Gender: 1

Phenotypic Features:

- Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (HP:0003774)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease → Diagnosed as Tubulointerstitial kidney disease, autosomal dominant, 1 (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease → Diagnosed as Tubulointerstitial kidney disease, autosomal dominant, 1 (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease → Diagnosed as Tubulointerstitial kidney disease, autosomal dominant, 1 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P33Y
- Gender: 1

Phenotypic Features:

- Unsteady gait (HP:0002317)
- Nystagmus (HP:0000639)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Myelodysplasia, Unsteady gait, Gait ataxia, Slow saccadic eye movements, Nystagmus, Diplopia, and Cerebellar atrophy → Diagnosed as Ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Neutropenia, Unsteady gait, Nystagmus, Ankle clonus, Thrombocytopenia, Anemia, Dysarthria, Dysmetria, and Recurrent infections → Diagnosed as Ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Nystagmus, Recurrent infections, Anemia, Thrombocytopenia, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Unsteady gait, Dysarthria, Dysmetria, and Ankle clonus → Diagnosed as Ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: 
- Gender: 1

Phenotypic Features:

- Clitoral hypertrophy (HP:0008665)
- Hyperpigmentation of the skin (HP:0000953)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Clitoral hypertrophy, and Hyperpigmentation of the skin → Diagnosed as Adrenal hyperplasia, congenital, due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Clitoral hypertrophy, and Hyperpigmentation of the skin → Diagnosed as Adrenal hyperplasia, congenital, due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Clitoral hypertrophy, Hyperpigmentation of the skin, Increased circulating ACTH level, and Decreased circulating cortisol level → Diagnosed as Adrenal hyperplasia, congenital, due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P8Y
- Gender: 1

Phenotypic Features:

- Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (HP:0004757)
- Shortened QT interval (HP:0012232)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Shortened QT interval, Mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, Palpitations, Presyncope, and Sudden cardiac death → Diagnosed as Short QT syndrome 3 (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Shortened QT interval, Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Palpitations, Presyncope, Mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and Sudden cardiac death → Diagnosed as Short QT syndrome 3 (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Shortened QT interval, Palpitations, Presyncope, Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and Sudden cardiac death → Diagnosed as Short QT syndrome 3 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P24Y
- Gender: 2

Phenotypic Features:

- Sensorineural hearing impairment (HP:0000407)




Similar Reference Cases (for guidance):
- Case 1: Presented with Sensorineural hearing impairment → Diagnosed as Deafness, autosomal recessive 124 (None)
- Case 2: Presented with Sensorineural hearing impairment → Diagnosed as Deafness, autosomal recessive 124 (None)
- Case 3: Presented with Sensorineural hearing impairment, Abnormal vestibular function, and Visual impairment → Diagnosed as Deafness, autosomal recessive 15 (None)



Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

```json

  "ranked_diseases": [
    {
      "disease_name": "DiseaseName",
      "disease_id": "DiseaseID",
      "score": 1.0,

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

```json
{
  "ranked_diseases": [
    {
      "disease_name": "DiseaseName",
      "disease_id": "DiseaseID",
      "score": 1.0,
