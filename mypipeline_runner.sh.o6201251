=== Prompt ===
You are a diagnostician for rare diseases, tasked with analyzing clinical data to identify potential causative diseases based on phenotypic features and use similar reference cases as a guide.
Patient Information:
- Age: P7M
- Gender: 1

Phenotypic Features:

- Fetal pericardial effusion (HP:0025671)
- Seizure (HP:0001250)
- Cerebellar atrophy (HP:0001272)
- Cerebral atrophy (HP:0002059)
- Esotropia (HP:0000565)
- Polycystic kidney dysplasia (HP:0000113)

- Failure to thrive (HP:0001508)
- Type I transferrin isoform profile (HP:0003642)
- Hypoalbuminemia (HP:0003073)




No similar reference cases were found in the database.


Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
- The diseases should be ranked based on their relevance to the provided phenotypic features and if provided based of the similar cases.
You MUST return your answer strictly in this JSON format without any extra text:

Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.

Task:
Based on the above clinical data, analyze the patient's condition and return a ranked list of the most likely causative diseases.
For each disease, provide the following fields:
- 'disease_name': The name of the disease, make sure all subtypes of the disease are considered in great detail e.g Noonan Syndrome 1, Noonan Syndrome 2, etc.
- 'disease_id': The disease identifier, in the form of a OMIM ID (e.g., OMIM:123456)
- 'score': The reciprocal of its rank (1/rank) eg if the disease is ranked 1st, the score is 1.0, if it is ranked 2nd, the score is 0.5, etc.
- 'explanation': A brief explanation for why the disease is ranked at that position

The list should be sorted in descending order, with the most likely disease first.
MUST RETURN A LIST OF POTENTIAL DISEASE, MORE THAN ONE  disease, even if the confidence is low.
